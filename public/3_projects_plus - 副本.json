{"0000026": {"id": "0000026", "title": "A Novel Ultrasonic Cooling Concept for Microelectrics", "abstract": "The purpose of the proposed work is to design a novel cooling device for microelectronic systems using ultrasonic flexural waves (UFW's) of a resonating structure.  The ultrasonic nature affords two essential features of such a device: Efficient cooling that derives from a high rate of acoustic streaming of air that causes convective heat transfer away from a heat source near the resonating structure and noise-free operation which is recognized as an important consumer benefit.  To achieve this, three objectives are sought.  First, the design of a chip-size cooling mechanism and on-chip assembly that will ensure optimum cooling capability will be investigated.  Second, a heat transfer analysis of UFW-based acoustic streaming will be carried out with a goal of accurately predicting the cooling performance of such a device.  Thirdly, based on the heat transfer analysis, a prototype design will be undertaken utilizing thin-film MEMS technology for power efficiency and economic viability.  Final testing and evaluation will be carried out using specifications and procedures typically employed for computer processors.", "similar_id": [41337, 37749, 33324], "weight": [0.18491429090499878, 0.29557785391807556, 0.5195078253746033], "similar_title": ["SGER Collaborative Research:  VisualizeIT - Measuring the Impact of IT-Enabled Concept Generation on Designer Creativity", "Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference", "CPA (Gr&Vis): Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2007 Conference"], "similar_abstract": ["This project creates and evaluates new visualization techniques of models from a concept generator to stimulate the designer to generate concepts not originally posed by designer or computer. This technology is expected to enable the development of creative solutions to design problems that would otherwise go undiscovered. The three challenges to achieving effective visualization for enhancing creative design at the concept generation phase are: 1) how to cluster the many concept variants returned from an automated concept generation algorithm into a manageable set of representative concepts that spans the design alternative space; 2) how to visually represent the option space to the designer so that it enhances creativity; and 3) how to measure the impact of the visualization schemes on designer creativity. This exploratory research, if successful, offers the opportunity to transform how we design products and systems and how we guide any designer to a creative new product.", "Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference<br/><br/>This conference brings together researchers academia and industry focused on research topics related to the Graphics and Visualization subarea of the CPA cluster.

detect cracks in welded steel connections. The 1994 Northridge earthquake caused extensive damage to the connections of structural steel, special moment-resisting frames. Critical welds fractured in more than 200 buildings throughout the epicentral area; however, the damage was difficult and expensive to detect because the steel members are covered with fireproofing. Removal of the architectural cladding and fireproofing for inspection is expensive, time consuming, and disrupted the normal activities of the building occupants.<br/><br/>The proposed sensor relies on RF technology. The sensor is a resonant circuit, similar in design to adhesive Electronic Article Surveillance stickers that are used to control inventory in retail stores around the country. The sensors will be attached to the structural steel frame during construction, and are passive. The frequency characteristics of the sensor will change when a crack in the weld material or base metal beneath the sensor reaches a given size. A wireless transmitter/receiver will be used to interrogate the sensor and obtain information about the presence of cracks without removing any of the architectural finishes or fireproofing. The proposed crack detection sensor is attractive because it is inexpensive, robust, easy to install, and maintenance free.<br/><br/>The research has been divided into eleven tasks need to transfer this technology into structural evaluation. Critical issues that must be addressed include selection of appropriate components for manufacturing of the sensor (polymer film, wire coil, and adhesive layer) determination of required surface treatment for the steel, evaluation of optimal sensor placement based on the configuration of the welded connection, determination of optimal coil geometry, and development of a wireless transmitter/receiver to generate a frequency sweep to interrogate multiple sensors.<br/><br/>This project is supported under the 3rd -Year Competition under NSF 98-36  \"US - Japan Cooperative Research in Urban Earthquake Disaster Mitigation\"<br/>", "similar_id": [6970, 41811, 55992], "weight": [0.07207967340946198, 0.10250842571258545, 0.825411856174469], "similar_title": ["High Performance Algorithms for Electronic Materials", "CAREER: Research and Education of Adsorption and Desorption of Air Pollutants on Engineered Nanomaterials", "Fundamental Investigation and Development of Screw Dislocation-Driven Nanowire Growth"], "similar_abstract": ["This grant is supported by the Divisions of Materials Research and Advanced Computational Infrastructure and Research.

Ramirez<br/><br/>Engineered nanomaterials have unique chemical and physical properties that make them desirable for widespread applications including environmental remediation, energy conversion, catalyst support and biomedical use. Despite their benefits, questions need to be answered about the impacts of such nanomaterials on human health, safety and the environment. Principal objectives of the proposed research are to investigate the transformations of engineered nanomaterials as they interact with hazardous air pollutants in the environment and to determine the efficiency of air pollution control devices to adsorb and desorb pollutants associated with engineered nanomaterials. Systematic research methods and innovative mathematical models based on quantitative-structure activity relationships will be developed to characterize the adsorption and desorption of hazardous air pollutants on engineered nanomaterials. This research project consists of the following main tasks: (1) to characterize the adsorption of hazardous air pollutants on engineered nanomaterials including C60 fullerenes, single- and multi- wall carbon nanotubes, and silica; (2) to examine the effect of humidity and nanomaterial morphology on the atmospheric adsorption and desorption of air pollutants on nanomaterials; (3) to model single- and multi-component sorption based on quantitative-structure activity relationships; and (4) examine the effect of concentration of pollutant associated nanomaterials on their removal efficiency using filtration and adsorption systems. The proposed research plan will be one of the first efforts to evaluate the efficiency of filtration and activated carbon adsorption systems, typically used in industry, for removing specific engineered nanomaterials in the gas phase. The research described in this proposal is novel and potentially transformative in that, if successful, it would lead to new technology for the evaluation of the impacts of hazardous air pollutant-associated engineered nanomaterials on human health, safety and the environment.<br/><br/>As a new Hispanic faculty member in the Environmental Engineering Department at Texas A&M University at Kingsville (TAMUK), a Hispanic-serving institution, the PI will recruit and mentor students from underrepresented groups, and to establish multidisciplinary research and education programs on atmospheric transformations of engineered nanomaterials at TAMUK with national and international collaborations.", "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project supported by Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program seeks to develop the rational design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) nanowire materials whose growth is driven by screw dislocations and to investigate their fundamental characteristics. Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 54077, "graph":

"0000031<br/>Engelhardt<br/>The objective of this research project is to develop and validate safe and economical link-to-column connections for use in steel eccentrically braced frames.<br/><br/>The 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquake exposed fundamental deficiencies in US design, detailing and welding practices for connections in steel moment frames.  Recent research conducted in both countries, however, has lead to major strides in understanding the problems associated with steel moment connections.<br/><br/>Eccentrically braced frames (EBFs) provide an alternative to moment frame as a lateral force resisting system in steel buildings.  The higher stiffness provided by an EBF could offer important advantages over a moment frame, and the use of EBFs have been constructed since the Northridge Earthquake, many using a configuration where the EBF link is attached to the column.  The link-to-column connection in such systems plays a critical role in the seismic performance and safety of the frame.<br/><br/>Many of the welding and design conditions responsible for the poor performance of moment frame connections in the Northridge Earthquake are also present in EBF link-to-column connections.  At the same time, the force and inelastic deformation demands at link-to-column connections are substantially greater than at moment frame connections.  However, virtually no research effort has been directed towards link-to-column connections in EBF to date.  Nonetheless, EBF construction is proceeding on he West Coast for major building projects using questionable connection details that have not been verified by testing.<br/><br/>A program of combined analytical and large-scale experimental studies will be conducted on link-to-column connections for seismic-resistant steel EBFs.  A variety of promising connection details will be investigated and refined using inelastic finite element studies.  Connection performance will then be evaluated using full-scale cyclic loading tests, followed by the development of design recommendations.<br/><br/>This project will be conducted in close collaboration with investigators at Kyoto University in Japan.  The planned collaboration includes coordinated experimental investigations between the US and Japanese sides, participation of a doctoral student from Kyoto University in the US side research, an dynamic testing of specimens fabricated in the US at Kyoto University using loading equipment not available in the US.

In many of the rapidly developing metallic materials that exhibit enhanced strengths, such as multilayered metals and ultrafine grained metals, the limiting factor is likely the creation and multiplication of dislocations, rather than the motion of dislocations. While there is substantial work on this topic by many groups around the world, most studies focus on pristine or extremely controlled structures, whereas most engineering alloys are complex, multicomponent systems that have prevalent defect structures. Exposure to radiation and existing non-equilibrium processing is particularly likely to generate excess vacancies and other point defects. This project will provide a fundamental study of the nucleation of and operation of sources dislocations with a wide range defect structures in metals using both experimental and computational studies. The team will experimentally quantify the impact of vacancies, impurities, and grain boundaries on dislocation nucleation and plasticity at extreme stresses in a variety of metallic systems using indentation techniques to probe the onset of plasticity. Point defect concentration will be assessed by positron porosimetry. Nanoindentation studies will also be used to demonstrate the impact of existing defects on the propagation of dislocations at the nm scale at high stresses, and these results will be compared to computational simulations using both molecular statics and dynamics. This coupling will develop stronger relationships between computational models of incipient plasticity and experimental studies through the development of multi-scale modeling techniques addressing both length and time scales.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Of the many methods used by engineers and scientists to strengthen metallic materials there is increased emphasis on developing nanoscale structures that exhibit the -smaller is stronger- paradigm, where having a smaller length scale in the material provides more resistance to deformation. This project will focus on determining the fundamental effects of existing defects in metals on the onset of plasticity. There will be an experimental component, wherein the onset of plasticity is measured in a variety of metallic materials to quantify the ultimate strength of the material. These results will be compared to computational simulations developed to address both time and length scale issues in modeling the onset of permanent deformation. The graduate students supported will be partnered with a group of materials science and engineering undergraduates that have developed an outreach kit of materials for junior high students, and will gain experience in organizing teams of engineering students and distributing the kits to dozens of underserved classrooms around the region.", "Current general circulation models (GCMs) have difficulty reproducing the rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss observed over the past decades. One possible factor is that they do not properly represent the radiative forcings from aerosols and tropospheric ozone that could be particularly important in the Arctic. This EaSM Type 1 project will develop an improved understanding of the distributions and decadal trends of aerosols and ozone in the Arctic, including black carbon (BC) deposition fluxes and albedo effects for snow and sea ice, and will study the implications for Arctic climate change over the 1980-2010 period. It will build an interdisciplinary partnership between atmospheric chemists using the GEOS-Chem CTM and cryosphere scientists using CCSM4, to better describe aerosol-chemistry-climate interactions in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The project will take advantage of intensive observations during the International Polar Year (IPY) to test and improve the GEOS-Chem representation of aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes in the Arctic. A 30-year GEOS-Chem simulation (1980-2010) with evolving sources from human activity and fires will be conducted and evaluated against long-term records. Aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes from GEOS-Chem will be input to CCSM4 to simulate Arctic radiative forcing and climate response over the 30-year period. Ensemble sensitivity simulations conducted with CCSM4 will diagnose the perturbations to temperature, sea ice, and atmospheric circulation associated with these radiative forcings. Knowledge gained from this project will be used to evaluate the simulation of Arctic aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and BC deposition fluxes within CESM. Fully coupled aerosol-chemistry-climate simulations of the 1980-2010 period will be conducted in CESM to assess Arctic climate response from aerosols and ozone and to investigate climate feedbacks.  This project will also provide policy analysts with information on the role of aerosols and tropospheric ozone in driving Arctic climate change.  Two graduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary environmental modeling.", "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project supported by Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program seeks to develop the rational design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) nanowire materials whose growth is driven by screw dislocations and to investigate their fundamental characteristics. Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 40365, "graph":

Loss of vestibular feedback in the sensorimotor control loop of the human body causes imbalance, which significantly increases the risk of falling, one of the leading causes of death in the elderly population. Patients with vestibular imbalance have reduced activity levels, which result in secondary problems including loss of muscle tone, decreased body strength, fatigue, and headache, leading to a significantly impaired life. The proposed device provides alternative sensory feedback to the palatal surface, a site that has been shown to possess high tactile sensitivity, but has not been explored for vestibular substitution. The objectives for Phase I of the project include: 1) development of a compact and energy-efficient electronic system that leads to a wearable battery-powered balance device; 2) development of methods for optimal electrotactile representation of the direction and range of head inclination and motion; and 3) preliminary evaluation of the wearable prototype for alternative sensory feedback and balance assistance in human subject experiments. The Phase I project is anticipated to demonstrate the enabling palate-based technology for cost-effective implementation of the device with desired dimensions and functionality, and the usefulness of the device for balance control.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the improvement of balance in patients with vestibular disorders, which are prevalent worldwide due to aging, disease, ototoxicity, and surgery that cause degradation or damage of the vestibular apparatus. Data showed that in US alone several millions of American adults reported problem with balance. Currently no practical devices are available to provide in-situ sensory feedback of head movement for patients with vestibular loss.  The proposed device captures this great market opportunity with its unique feature of being hidden and noninvasive while assisting vestibular patients in maintaining balance in various indoor and outdoor activities such as walking in a park, street, or shopping mall. It helps them to regain confidence in public settings, and increases their social participation, which will bring enormous benefits to their health and make their daily living more enjoyable. In addition, the device offers fresh opportunities for health professionals in the field of vestibular rehabilitation to conduct research on motion, imbalance, and treatments in uncontrolled settings. It provides a new tool for neuroscience researchers to study mechanisms of brain plasticity and perceptual learning involving use of palatal feedback in the sensorimotor control loop.", "0713983<br/>Lok, Benjamin <br/>University of Florida<br/><br/>Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2007 Conference<br/><br/>This conference brings together researchers academia and industry focused on research topics related to the Graphics and Visualization subarea of the CPA cluster.

Furthermore, this work will transform neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life for a large number of neurological patients. The central question that motivates this proposal is: Does the brain use motor programs to help it control a highly redundant multi-degree of freedom (DOF) biomechanical plant such as the arm? To answer this question, this project will conduct a series of experiments that require a combination of three major innovations at the experimental (BMI), theoretical (hybrid control), and technical (exoskeleton design) level. This proposal aims to synthesize all three innovations into a new experimental paradigm unifying brain, biomechanics, and behavior. Specifically, visually-cued motor plans in the motor cortices of macaque monkeys will be: 1) read by a BMI, 2) interpreted by a hybrid controller and a musculoskeletal model, and 3) translated into appropriate movements and stiffness in a multi-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>At a societal level, this proposal seeks to create a significant advancement in neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from paralysis due to lesions of the central nervous system or other neurological disorders. BMIs will make a great impact in the quality of life for neurological patients by providing reliable performance when interacting with real objects and in real-world scenarios. This proposal also informs motor systems neuroscience by proposing a novel framework to study how neural ensembles can learn to control a multi-DOF exoskeleton by volitional modulation of neural activity in real-world tasks. It provides a critical link between neural events and real-world dynamics through a novel hierarchical distributed control scheme for hybrid systems identification and control that captures the continuous time evolution of the arm/exoskeleton, as well as the dynamically changing sequence of tasks. No motor task of this complexity has ever been demonstrated in a BMI system. The potential impact of the proposed work is immense. If successful, this work will transform our understanding about how the brain controls movement, and will introduce a paradigm shift in the development of the next generation of neural prosthetics that will restore motor function in millions of neurologically impaired patients ? a development which may very well impact other domains such as human-machine interaction and innovative user interfaces. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The dissemination of data and research findings from this project will be done through a project website. Our codes will be open source, and the methods, algorithms and results will be available through publications in the fields of neuroscience, control and robotics. Through the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at Berkeley, research results from this program will be immediately accessible and distributed to a large engineering community, in particular other interdisciplinary research groups. Also, the findings in the proposed research will be outreached to K-12 students and their parents through various activities at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS), such as CAL-day. In addition, research findings will be disseminated through workshops at the main annual conferences in neuroscience, robotics, control, and biomedical engineering. The educational component of this proposal relies on BMI as a platform for interdisciplinary education in science and engineering. New graduate-level courses will be introduced and existing courses will be enhanced based on results of this project. The proposed efforts will open doors to student rotations between neuroscientists, control theorists and roboticists. In addition to postdocs and graduate students, undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the project: modeling, analysis, simulation, prototype development and experimentation. Special effort will be placed on the recruitment of individuals from underrepresented groups including women, thereby building on the strong record the PIs have in this area."], "person": 17110,

Vakakis / Lawrence A. Bergman, Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<br/>Proposal No. CMS-0000060<br/>Proposal Title: Nonlinear Localization for Shock Isolation of Flexible Structures<br/><br/>Project Abstract:<br/><br/>A unique response reduction strategy for complex structures subjected to shock-induced vibrations is proposed. The vulnerability of flexible structures to large magnitude transient inputs is well documented. Various methods have been proposed and, in some cases, implemented through which the reliability of these structures can be enhanced. Typical solutions include passive isolation and auxiliary damping devices, which have been employed for many years with varying degrees of success. The primary focus of the proposed research is the development of a new type of passive nonlinear shock isolation system for protection of flexible structures, based upon the concept of nonlinear localization. Here, rather than relying strictly on compliance and adequate \"rattle space,\" the system takes induced vibrational energy and passively confines it to a preassigned secondary system away from the primary structure to be isolated, where it can be passively dissipated. The technique has been applied successfully to complex systems subjected to periodic loading, and in this project its efficacy under transient conditions will be studied, both analytically and experimentally.<br/>The project consists of three main tasks. First, a series of one-dimensional simulations and scale model experiments will be conducted to validate the concept of nonlinear localization in the context of protecting flexible structures subjected to large, transient inputs. Next, performance of a shock isolation system applied to a large, complex structure subjected to a series of multi-axial transients will be evaluated by modeling and simulation. Finally, a proof of concept experiment will be conducted using a larger scale structure on a multi-axis simulator.<br/>Through the use of nonlinear localization, the resulting shock isolation system will serve a dual purpose, providing protection in the linear regime for small-scale inputs and in the nonlinear regime for larger scale transients, while limiting the deformation ordinarily required for protection in the latter regime. The potential payoff is more compact and efficient passive protective systems.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Impact of Budget Revision:<br/><br/> The original two year budget provided for a total of two months (one month per year) of summer support for each of the two PI's and two calendar years of support for each of 2 Ph.D.-level graduate students. In order to reduce the overall budget from $261,868 to $180,000, summer support for each investigator is reduced to .10 month per year for each PI. This change will impact the summer progress of the graduate students, though hopefully not in a substantial way. Further, one Ph.D.-level student has been replaced by an M.S.-level student.<br/>On the experimental side, there will be no change to the one-dimensional experiment. We will, however, attempt to coordinate the multi-axial test program with another academic institution having an appropriate shaker facility. Assuming some coordination is possible at minimal cost, the goals of the project will remain fundamentally unchanged. The budget has been revised to reflect this.<br/>", "similar_id": [29345, 55992, 50010], "weight": [0.15462933480739594, 0.6907414197921753, 0.15462933480739594], "similar_title": ["Nonlinear Model Updating Using Ambient Responses For Damage Diagnosis In Concrete Structures", "Fundamental Investigation and Development of Screw Dislocation-Driven Nanowire Growth", "Nonlinear Model Updating Using Ambient Responses For Damage Diagnosis In Concrete Structures"], "similar_abstract": ["Abstract: <br/><br/>The focus of the research is on the development of a reliable method to update nonlinear finite element models of concrete structures to represent the damaged state of the structure.

Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers.", "Abstract: <br/><br/>The focus of the research is on the development of a reliable method to update nonlinear finite element models of concrete structures to represent the damaged state of the structure.

and experimental verification of high-speed machining (HSM) of different workmaterials.  In specific, thermal modeling of shear localization in HSM will be conducted using different difficult-to-machine materials, such as titanium alloys, nickel-based superalloys, and hardened steels taking into account various heat sources (primary, preheating, and image) using the classical Jeager's stationary and moving heat source models.  The onset of shear localization will be predicted based on thermo-mechanical shear instability of different workmaterials. Depending on the thermo-mechanical properties of the workmaterial and the cutting conditions, the cutting speed for the onset of shear instability will be determined.  In addition to the conventional machine tools, such as a precision lathe and an NC milling machine, a high-speed spindle (Bryant) (50,000 rpm, 50 hp) will be used for conducting the high-speed machining tests. Attempts will be made to measure the temperature generated in machining under shear localized conditions using either advanced thermally sensitive paints and optical infrared techniques.<br/><br/>Some of the difficult-to-machine materials including titanium alloys, nickel-base superalloys, and hardened steels are challenging materials in the aerospace and aircraft industries. New tool materials and tool geometries are being specifically developed to dramatically increase the productivity in machining. Fundamental knowledge on the nature of chip formation process, forces, energy consumed, tool wear can provide the basis for the implementation of this technology in industry.

This is a renewal of a successful 3 year RET Site program. <br/><br/>The SMARTER program will provide a professional development opportunity to a total of 36 middle and high school in-service teachers (12 per year for three years) in the areas of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and entrepreneurship from the New York City Public Schools.  During each year of the project, under the guidance of Dr. Kapila and six senior personnel, 12 teachers will receive mentoring and conduct inquiry-based, hands-on, engineering research in the exciting field of mechatronics through six-week long summer workshops.  Collaborative activities involving Technology Management faculty and the Centers for Entrepreneurship and Technology will enable teachers to learn about entrepreneurship, conduct innovation case-studies, and shadow entrepreneurs.  <br/><br/>The project will benefit the teachers by reinforcing their science and math skills; enriching their STEM experience through exposure to real-world engineering research; developing and honing their research skills; cultivating and sustaining creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship traits; and providing opportunities to network with tech-entrepreneurs.  Moreover, the teachers' schools will benefit since the participants will be able to provide their students with a solid foundation for college-level study in STEM; integrate hands-on activities with content and performance standards in curriculum; and mentor students to participate in an Inno/Vention student idea competition.  A business-philanthropy partnership will allow teachers' students to gain real-world entrepreneurial experience through summer internships at start-up technology businesses.  The project will serve as a catalyst to induce a cultural change that will transform students from being mere consumers of technology to becoming creators of novel technological products.", "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project supported by Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program seeks to develop the rational design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) nanowire materials whose growth is driven by screw dislocations and to investigate their fundamental characteristics. Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 48334, "graph":

forming (LF) is a process in which sheet metal forming is achieved through controlled temperature gradients and thermal stresses produced by the rapid absorption of power from a scanning laser beam. LF requires no hard tooling and has the flexibility for low-volume fabrication and rapid prototyping of sheet metal components. LF can also be used to fine adjust sheet metal parts for, say, pre-welding fit-up. The goal of this project is to advance the state of knowledge in LF technology, and to develop capabilities for LF to produce sheet metal components with controlled dimension, mechanical properties, and microstructures, and to markedly improve accuracy, scalability and reliability of the LF process. The project will develop a numerical model for LF having much improved prediction capabilities and accuracy by coupling microstructural transformations analysis with thermal and mechanical analysis and by incorporating accurate material data at high temperatures and high strain rates; and carry out an aggressive experimental program for model validation through detailed in-process and post-process characterizations. Other thermal-mechanical manufacturing methods will be able to leverage upon the improved understanding and prediction capabilities of the coupled thermal-mechanical- microstructural model to be developed in this project.<br/><br/>The success of the project will open-up new opportunities for manufacturing of high-performance but conventionally hard-to-form materials, leading to innovative applications, thus opening new design options.", "similar_id": [58428, 33324, 37749], "weight": [0.11816097050905228, 0.26407867670059204, 0.6177603602409363], "similar_title": ["EFRI-M3C: A Hybrid Control Systems Approach to Brain-Machine Interfaces for Exoskeleton Control", "CPA (Gr&Vis): Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2007 Conference", "Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference"], "similar_abstract": ["This interdisciplinary research proposal brings together leaders in neurophysiology and brain-machine interfaces (BMI), control systems, and exoskeleton design to significantly advance our understanding of fundamental principles in the neural control of movement in scenarios that involve physical interactions with the world. Furthermore, this work will transform neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life for a large number of neurological patients. The central question that motivates this proposal is: Does the brain use motor programs to help it control a highly redundant multi-degree of freedom (DOF) biomechanical plant such as the arm? To answer this question, this project will conduct a series of experiments that require a combination of three major innovations at the experimental (BMI), theoretical (hybrid control), and technical (exoskeleton design) level. This proposal aims to synthesize all three innovations into a new experimental paradigm unifying brain, biomechanics, and behavior. Specifically, visually-cued motor plans in the motor cortices of macaque monkeys will be: 1) read by a BMI, 2) interpreted by a hybrid controller and a musculoskeletal model, and 3) translated into appropriate movements and stiffness in a multi-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>At a societal level, this proposal seeks to create a significant advancement in neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from paralysis due to lesions of the central nervous system or other neurological disorders. BMIs will make a great impact in the quality of life for neurological patients by providing reliable performance when interacting with real objects and in real-world scenarios. This proposal also informs motor systems neuroscience by proposing a novel framework to study how neural ensembles can learn to control a multi-DOF exoskeleton by volitional modulation of neural activity in real-world tasks. It provides a critical link between neural events and real-world dynamics through a novel hierarchical distributed control scheme for hybrid systems identification and control that captures the continuous time evolution of the arm/exoskeleton, as well as the dynamically changing sequence of tasks. No motor task of this complexity has ever been demonstrated in a BMI system. The potential impact of the proposed work is immense. If successful, this work will transform our understanding about how the brain controls movement, and will introduce a paradigm shift in the development of the next generation of neural prosthetics that will restore motor function in millions of neurologically impaired patients ? a development which may very well impact other domains such as human-machine interaction and innovative user interfaces. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The dissemination of data and research findings from this project will be done through a project website. Our codes will be open source, and the methods, algorithms and results will be available through publications in the fields of neuroscience, control and robotics. Through the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at Berkeley, research results from this program will be immediately accessible and distributed to a large engineering community, in particular other interdisciplinary research groups. Also, the findings in the proposed research will be outreached to K-12 students and their parents through various activities at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS), such as CAL-day. In addition, research findings will be disseminated through workshops at the main annual conferences in neuroscience, robotics, control, and biomedical engineering. The educational component of this proposal relies on BMI as a platform for interdisciplinary education in science and engineering. New graduate-level courses will be introduced and existing courses will be enhanced based on results of this project. The proposed efforts will open doors to student rotations between neuroscientists, control theorists and roboticists. In addition to postdocs and graduate students, undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the project: modeling, analysis, simulation, prototype development and experimentation.

Gertler, Professor, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia and Dr. Alaa Sheta, Assistant Professor, Computers and Systems Department, Electronics Research Institute, Cairo, Egypt.  These two scientists plan to extend current research carried out by Dr. Gertler in the area of fault detection and diagnosis under a separate NSF grant.  The extension will utilize paradigms inspired by natural evolution and genetics in adaptive process modeling and control.  These computational algorithms are known as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs).  The two scientists plan to develop model structures using EAs.  This model will be utilized in creating parity relations.  The EA-based approach is expected to enhance the analytical method and provide more accurate results.  In a related effort, they will consider the development of an intelligent controller for the selected chemical process.  The type of controller chosen is the model-based predictive controller.  This type of controller has been successfully used in many industrial processes with promising results. <br/><br/>Scope:  This award will allow a US scientist to collaborate with an Egyptian scientist.  The research area, a new field within the broad topic of Intelligent Control (IC), is one in which control algorithms are developed by emulating certain characteristics of intelligent biological systems.  Dr. Gertler, the US scientist, is well known in the area of fault detection and diagnosis.  Dr. Sheta, the Egyptian scientist, is an expert in the area of system identification, control, optimization and evolutionary algorithms.  He has developed a number of methods for identification and control of nonlinear dynamical systems in noisy environments.  In this project, Dr. Sheta will be responsible for developing model structures for the process under study, and for the adaptation of a simulation program for the process, and will be involved in experimentation on chemical process simulators.

It is known that many important phenomena in materials science originate from the strong repulsion between electrons in solids.  These include all of magnetism, metal-insulator transitions and, more recently, superconductivity.  A particularly exciting recent development is the discovery of materials which are candidates for the long sought quantum spin liquid.  In these systems the electrons are localized by correlation but their spins do not form an ordered state down to the lowest temperature due to quantum fluctuations.  Past theoretical work has predicted that many novel phenomena may emerge at low temperatures, such as specific heat and thermal conductivity which behave like metals in these materials which are charge insulators.  These predictions have recently been observed experimentally.  The plan is to build on the past success to achieve a deeper understanding of this novel phenomenon.  Theory will be developed which aims to explain in detail the experimental observations and to predict new ones.  It is possible that an understanding of the quantum spin liquid will pave the way towards an understanding of the high temperature superconductors, especially in the under doped region, where the formation of quantum spin liquids may be the driving force behind the many anomalous properties observed there.  Theoretical work on the high temperature superconductors will be pursued armed with new insights gained from the studies of quantum spin liquids.  Progress on these long standing problems represent a new paradigm and will have strong impact on condensed matter physics and materials science.<br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education in condensed matter physics.  The theoretical work takes it inspiration from experimental discovery in new materials and aims to explain and predict novel phenomena.  Such novel phenomena often arise in materials where electrons are strongly interacting with each other, and this work will focus on this rich arena.  Past examples include Nobel winning discoveries such as the fractional quantum Hall effect and high temperature superconductivity.  This research area is particularly well suited for the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows because both mathematical sophistication and an understanding of real materials are required to make progress.", "This project provides support to Dr. Aly Fathy, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Tennessee Knoxville to organize and host a workshop with Dr. Hadia El-Hennawy, Dean of Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt on emerging microwave technologies in Cairo Egypt from 20-21 October 2010.  The workshop will assess the current status of the science and identify future directions in which to stimulate new research directions for microwave technology including design, material characterization, various engineering aspects and applications. Participation is expected by scientists from the US, Egypt, as well as other countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region including Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and Lebanon.  To further ensure wide participation, this workshop will be held after the IEEE-Microwave Theory and Technology Administrative Committee?s meeting in Cairo, Egypt 16-17 October 2010.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The workshop addresses important technical areas i.e. microwave devices, materials, and related technologies. This is an important area in terms of research that addresses energy harvesting (e.g. solar) as well as many other issues such as wireless communications including ultra-wide band (UWB) communication.  The main objective of this workshop is to have in-depth discussions on new technological, experimental, computational, and theoretical advances in processing, characterization, multi-scale modeling in microwave engineering. The workshop will also provide a venue for better understanding the fundamental science underlying new processes and device applications of new semiconductor materials like Gallium Nitride GaN.  <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The proposed workshop targets areas of global interest namely communications and energy harvesting. The workshop will allow scientists from the U. S. and the MENA region countries to exchange their experiences, ideas, and information about the recent advancement of microwave technologies. The workshop will provide a forum to identify and foster potential collaborations among the workshop participants, which will stimulate new research directions of microwave communications, devices, and energy technology including design, material characterization, various engineering aspects and applications for the benefit of the public and private sectors.  This workshop has great potential for developing additional, new collaborations between the participants and the cooperative research derived from this workshop will likely lead to several new and far reaching research and educational activities, as well as economic developments involving the private sectors in the United States and the MENA region countries.", "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project supported by Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program seeks to develop the rational design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) nanowire materials whose growth is driven by screw dislocations and to investigate their fundamental characteristics. Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 25214, "graph":

Ramirez<br/><br/>Engineered nanomaterials have unique chemical and physical properties that make them desirable for widespread applications including environmental remediation, energy conversion, catalyst support and biomedical use. Despite their benefits, questions need to be answered about the impacts of such nanomaterials on human health, safety and the environment. Principal objectives of the proposed research are to investigate the transformations of engineered nanomaterials as they interact with hazardous air pollutants in the environment and to determine the efficiency of air pollution control devices to adsorb and desorb pollutants associated with engineered nanomaterials. Systematic research methods and innovative mathematical models based on quantitative-structure activity relationships will be developed to characterize the adsorption and desorption of hazardous air pollutants on engineered nanomaterials. This research project consists of the following main tasks: (1) to characterize the adsorption of hazardous air pollutants on engineered nanomaterials including C60 fullerenes, single- and multi- wall carbon nanotubes, and silica; (2) to examine the effect of humidity and nanomaterial morphology on the atmospheric adsorption and desorption of air pollutants on nanomaterials; (3) to model single- and multi-component sorption based on quantitative-structure activity relationships; and (4) examine the effect of concentration of pollutant associated nanomaterials on their removal efficiency using filtration and adsorption systems. The proposed research plan will be one of the first efforts to evaluate the efficiency of filtration and activated carbon adsorption systems, typically used in industry, for removing specific engineered nanomaterials in the gas phase. The research described in this proposal is novel and potentially transformative in that, if successful, it would lead to new technology for the evaluation of the impacts of hazardous air pollutant-associated engineered nanomaterials on human health, safety and the environment.<br/><br/>As a new Hispanic faculty member in the Environmental Engineering Department at Texas A&M University at Kingsville (TAMUK), a Hispanic-serving institution, the PI will recruit and mentor students from underrepresented groups, and to establish multidisciplinary research and education programs on atmospheric transformations of engineered nanomaterials at TAMUK with national and international collaborations.", "This grant is supported by the Divisions of Materials Research and Advanced Computational Infrastructure and Research.

Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 53836, "graph":

The design is based on DC-DC converter and Inverter topology, and this topology itself is not a new scheme; it has been used in many cases of PV systems.  Also, the proposed scheme is designed to use the maximum power point (Voltage or current) derived from a MPPT algorithm (which assumed to be installed in a microcomputer based system).  Actually, the main reason that the MMPT is not well accepted in a small PV project is that the high-cost of the computer based maximum power tracker.  The PV market and application have yet to justify the adoption of MPT in terms of the benefit of just a little more power drawn from the PV cells against the initial costs of the MPT.   In a small size PV application, more economical power tracker is highly sought.

It supports theoretical research and education with the objective to model proton conduction in metal-organic frameworks through the development and application of a novel simulation methodology. Proton conduction in solids and porous materials is a process of fundamental importance for fuel cell technologies. Much of current research on fuel cells focuses on proton exchange membranes where the electrolytes are Nafion or some other sulfonated polymers. Since high proton conductivity is only obtained at high levels of hydration, the maximum operation temperature of current fuel cells is limited by the condensation point of water. Metal-organic frameworks are conceptually different separator materials that can transport protons at high temperatures and in low-humidity environments. One of the main advantages of metal-organic frameworks is the possibility to modify the inner surface of their pores with respect to hydrophilicity and acidity via suitable organic ligands, which can be used to control proton conduction at the molecular level. <br/><br/>This research project focuses on the molecular-level modeling of proton conduction in several chemically and structurally different metal-organic frameworks, all of which are of considerable interest for possible applications in fuel cell technologies. The specific foci are: 1) Proton conduction via water molecules adsorbed in the nanochannels, 2) Proton conduction via nitrogen-containing molecules adsorbed in the nanochannels, 3) Proton conduction in functionalized metal-organic frameworks. Proton conduction presents a challenge for current computational methodologies due to the dynamically changing bonding topologies of numerous molecular structures and complexity of the surrounding chemical environment. A precise characterization of proton conduction requires a physically complete representation of the underlying many-body interactions as well as an extensive sampling of the relevant phase space. The rigorous combination of these two components ultimately leads to the correct description of the free-energy landscape that governs the thermodynamics and kinetics of proton transport. A novel computational approach will be developed that meets this challenge by combining an ab initio-based representation of proton hopping with an accurate description of the framework-framework and framework-guests interactions. This will provide molecular-level insights into the mechanisms that govern proton transport in metal-organic frameworks, which is the first, necessary step toward the rational design of new conducting metal-organic framework structures that can function at higher temperatures and lower relative humidity for application in next generation fuel cells. <br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows will be involved in the research and will acquire a solid foundation in theoretical, physical, and materials chemistry. The computational approach developed within this project will be integrated in Amber, a popular molecular dynamics simulation package.

It supports an integrated theoretical and computational research and education program related to fuel cell technologies as alternative energy sources. The increasing energy demands and associated effects on the environment pose strict constraints on future use of natural resources such as oil and gas. Considerable effort has recently been devoted to the development of alternative energy sources such as fuel cells that convert chemical energy into directly usable forms. For example, hydrogen fuel cells exploit a fundamental chemical reaction in which the electrons are first drawn from hydrogen molecules to produce protons at the anode, and then are transferred to the cathode through an external circuit that produces direct current. At the same time, the protons are transported across a permeable membrane from the anode to the cathode where they are reunited with the electrons to form molecular hydrogen that subsequently reacts with oxygen to form water. The net result is thus the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy. Since the overall products are water and heat, hydrogen fuel cells are clean technologies with regard to environmental issues. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why fuel cells have not yet found wider application is related to their efficiency, which strongly depends on the ability of protons to quickly travel across the membrane from the anode to the cathode. The particular nature of the membranes that are currently used represent the major obstacle to the development of more efficient fuel cells. The primary goal of this project is to use computer simulation to characterize the molecular mechanisms that determine proton conduction in a new class of materials known as metal-organic frameworks. Metal-organic frameworks contain organic molecules that act as bridges between inorganic clusters to form highly porous three-dimensional structures. Due to the presence of microscopic pores and channels, metal-organic frameworks can thus be used as effective separators in fuel cell technologies in which protons can be shuttled from the anode to the cathode through intervening carrier molecules or through the framework itself.<br/><br/>The proposed project focuses on the molecular-level modeling of proton conduction in several chemically and structurally different metal-organic frameworks, all of which are of considerable interest for possible applications in future fuel cell technologies. In general terms, proton conduction presents an enormous challenge for current computational approaches due to its intrinsic complexity. A new methodology will be developed that meets this challenge by combining state-of-the-art simulation techniques with accurate descriptions of the molecular interactions. The resulting computational approach will be integrated into Amber, which is one of the most popular software packages for molecular dynamics simulations. Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows will be involved in the research and will acquire a solid foundation in theoretical, physical, and materials chemistry.

Furthermore, this work will transform neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life for a large number of neurological patients. The central question that motivates this proposal is: Does the brain use motor programs to help it control a highly redundant multi-degree of freedom (DOF) biomechanical plant such as the arm? To answer this question, this project will conduct a series of experiments that require a combination of three major innovations at the experimental (BMI), theoretical (hybrid control), and technical (exoskeleton design) level. This proposal aims to synthesize all three innovations into a new experimental paradigm unifying brain, biomechanics, and behavior. Specifically, visually-cued motor plans in the motor cortices of macaque monkeys will be: 1) read by a BMI, 2) interpreted by a hybrid controller and a musculoskeletal model, and 3) translated into appropriate movements and stiffness in a multi-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>At a societal level, this proposal seeks to create a significant advancement in neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from paralysis due to lesions of the central nervous system or other neurological disorders. BMIs will make a great impact in the quality of life for neurological patients by providing reliable performance when interacting with real objects and in real-world scenarios. This proposal also informs motor systems neuroscience by proposing a novel framework to study how neural ensembles can learn to control a multi-DOF exoskeleton by volitional modulation of neural activity in real-world tasks. It provides a critical link between neural events and real-world dynamics through a novel hierarchical distributed control scheme for hybrid systems identification and control that captures the continuous time evolution of the arm/exoskeleton, as well as the dynamically changing sequence of tasks. No motor task of this complexity has ever been demonstrated in a BMI system. The potential impact of the proposed work is immense. If successful, this work will transform our understanding about how the brain controls movement, and will introduce a paradigm shift in the development of the next generation of neural prosthetics that will restore motor function in millions of neurologically impaired patients ? a development which may very well impact other domains such as human-machine interaction and innovative user interfaces. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The dissemination of data and research findings from this project will be done through a project website. Our codes will be open source, and the methods, algorithms and results will be available through publications in the fields of neuroscience, control and robotics. Through the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at Berkeley, research results from this program will be immediately accessible and distributed to a large engineering community, in particular other interdisciplinary research groups. Also, the findings in the proposed research will be outreached to K-12 students and their parents through various activities at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS), such as CAL-day. In addition, research findings will be disseminated through workshops at the main annual conferences in neuroscience, robotics, control, and biomedical engineering. The educational component of this proposal relies on BMI as a platform for interdisciplinary education in science and engineering. New graduate-level courses will be introduced and existing courses will be enhanced based on results of this project. The proposed efforts will open doors to student rotations between neuroscientists, control theorists and roboticists. In addition to postdocs and graduate students, undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the project: modeling, analysis, simulation, prototype development and experimentation. Special effort will be placed on the recruitment of individuals from underrepresented groups including women, thereby building on the strong record the PIs have in this area.", "0713983<br/>Lok, Benjamin <br/>University of Florida<br/><br/>Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2007 Conference<br/><br/>This conference brings together researchers academia and industry focused on research topics related to the Graphics and Visualization subarea of the CPA cluster.

The main objective of this research therefore is to develop new methods for rapid local area sensing and 3D modeling for planning and control of construction operations involving automated equipment.  It is a premise of this research that such modeling can be made feasible by deploying sensors efficiently and adding manual guidance.<br/>", "similar_id": [55830, 37749, 55992], "weight": [0.01921474188566208, 0.042165275663137436, 0.9386199712753296], "similar_title": ["Physics of Strong Disorder and Correlation", "Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference", "Fundamental Investigation and Development of Screw Dislocation-Driven Nanowire Growth"], "similar_abstract": ["TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical work on the physics of strongly correlated electronic systems.  It is known that many important phenomena in materials science originate from the strong repulsion between electrons in solids.  These include all of magnetism, metal-insulator transitions and, more recently, superconductivity.  A particularly exciting recent development is the discovery of materials which are candidates for the long sought quantum spin liquid.  In these systems the electrons are localized by correlation but their spins do not form an ordered state down to the lowest temperature due to quantum fluctuations.  Past theoretical work has predicted that many novel phenomena may emerge at low temperatures, such as specific heat and thermal conductivity which behave like metals in these materials which are charge insulators.  These predictions have recently been observed experimentally.  The plan is to build on the past success to achieve a deeper understanding of this novel phenomenon.  Theory will be developed which aims to explain in detail the experimental observations and to predict new ones.  It is possible that an understanding of the quantum spin liquid will pave the way towards an understanding of the high temperature superconductors, especially in the under doped region, where the formation of quantum spin liquids may be the driving force behind the many anomalous properties observed there.  Theoretical work on the high temperature superconductors will be pursued armed with new insights gained from the studies of quantum spin liquids.  Progress on these long standing problems represent a new paradigm and will have strong impact on condensed matter physics and materials science.<br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education in condensed matter physics.  The theoretical work takes it inspiration from experimental discovery in new materials and aims to explain and predict novel phenomena.  Such novel phenomena often arise in materials where electrons are strongly interacting with each other, and this work will focus on this rich arena.  Past examples include Nobel winning discoveries such as the fractional quantum Hall effect and high temperature superconductivity.  This research area is particularly well suited for the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows because both mathematical sophistication and an understanding of real materials are required to make progress.", "Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference<br/><br/>This conference brings together researchers academia and industry focused on research topics related to the Graphics and Visualization subarea of the CPA cluster. A five-member student panel will be supported that allows students to take a more active and integral role in voicing new research directions of interest to the research community. Among the topics to be discussed on the student panel are defining the future of virtual reality research, identifying killer virtual reality applications, and building careers in this research area. This outreach activity helps to broaden the participation of students in this research field.", "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project supported by Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program seeks to develop the rational design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) nanowire materials whose growth is driven by screw dislocations and to investigate their fundamental characteristics. Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 7486, "graph": {"paper_cite_paper":

Ramirez<br/><br/>Engineered nanomaterials have unique chemical and physical properties that make them desirable for widespread applications including environmental remediation, energy conversion, catalyst support and biomedical use. Despite their benefits, questions need to be answered about the impacts of such nanomaterials on human health, safety and the environment. Principal objectives of the proposed research are to investigate the transformations of engineered nanomaterials as they interact with hazardous air pollutants in the environment and to determine the efficiency of air pollution control devices to adsorb and desorb pollutants associated with engineered nanomaterials. Systematic research methods and innovative mathematical models based on quantitative-structure activity relationships will be developed to characterize the adsorption and desorption of hazardous air pollutants on engineered nanomaterials. This research project consists of the following main tasks: (1) to characterize the adsorption of hazardous air pollutants on engineered nanomaterials including C60 fullerenes, single- and multi- wall carbon nanotubes, and silica; (2) to examine the effect of humidity and nanomaterial morphology on the atmospheric adsorption and desorption of air pollutants on nanomaterials; (3) to model single- and multi-component sorption based on quantitative-structure activity relationships; and (4) examine the effect of concentration of pollutant associated nanomaterials on their removal efficiency using filtration and adsorption systems. The proposed research plan will be one of the first efforts to evaluate the efficiency of filtration and activated carbon adsorption systems, typically used in industry, for removing specific engineered nanomaterials in the gas phase. The research described in this proposal is novel and potentially transformative in that, if successful, it would lead to new technology for the evaluation of the impacts of hazardous air pollutant-associated engineered nanomaterials on human health, safety and the environment.<br/><br/>As a new Hispanic faculty member in the Environmental Engineering Department at Texas A&M University at Kingsville (TAMUK), a Hispanic-serving institution, the PI will recruit and mentor students from underrepresented groups, and to establish multidisciplinary research and education programs on atmospheric transformations of engineered nanomaterials at TAMUK with national and international collaborations.", "This grant is supported by the Divisions of Materials Research and Advanced Computational Infrastructure and Research.

Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 23233, "graph":

Lithography Technology for Asymmetric Resonant Cavities of Micro - and Meso-Scale Lasers, Amplifiers and Filters", "abstract": "0000170<br/>Lee<br/><br/>The PI and his group will study novel photonic devices fabricated by gray-scale lithography which exploit a new type of optical resonant micro-cavity known as an Asymmetric Resonant Cavity (ARC).  The ARC is a compact dialectic micro-cavity based on total (or partial) internal reflection which has been shown to support high-Q modes, emit with high directionality and (in the case of semiconductor mid-infrared lasers) with high output power.  The ARC concept is based on smooth oval deformations of cylindrical or spherical whispering gallery resonators.  Prior to the work proposed below, only limited use has been made of sophisticated modem lithographic techniques in developing the ARC-based devices, which require sub-micron accuracy and well-controlled height profiles.  They will investigate ARCs based on glass, Er-doped glass, GaAs, InGaAs/GaAlAs and silicon/germanium.<br/><br/>The proposed project will demonstrate further useful properties of ARCs for meso-optical devices, by employing the newly developed gray scale lithography.  Specifically they hope to test and demonstrate the following important features:<br/><br/>Improved lasing characteristics of ARC micro-lasers over a wide range of wavelength bands and gain materials.<br/>The possibility of lasing emission from ARC micro-lasers from two qualitatively different modes, i.e. different in both emission directionality and wavelength.<br/>Demonstrate similar properties for ARC-based optical amplifiers.<br/>Improved input-output coupling between waveguides and ARC micro-resonators due to nonevanescent coupling to ARCS, resulting in much improved design tolerances.<br/>Demonstrate how to exploit unique directional properties of ARC resonances for filtering operations useful for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) applications in planar integrated optics.<br/>Demonstrate device configurations which convert planar propagation or emission to propagation or emission perpendicular to the plane.  Configurations proposed are ARCs with auxiliary mesoreflectors, or axicon-domed ARCS.  These configurations rely essentially on unique features of gray-scale lithography.<br/><br/>Lithography can be applied to define lateral shapes, but exposure control will define the surface profiles.  UCSD will develop two complimentary fabrication methods.  One is based on dry etching for ARCs of height profiles < 5 microns and another on Sandia's LIGA foundry process for profiles > 5 microns.  Both methods will employ gray scale lithography, which UCSD pioneered, and which is superior to binary lithography for producing higher quality and lower cost optical components.  However, the gray scale technology must be modified by employing thicker diamond-like-coatings on the gray scale masks for wider dynamic ranges of exposure, and thicker analog photoresist layers.  The LIGA process at Sandia now works only with binary lithography; but they have agreed to work with us to introduce gray scale lithography into their LIGA process.  Moreover, Sandia has produced LIGA parts only in PMMA, metals and ceramics to date, whereas the preferred materials for ARCs are glass, silicon and germanium.  The exciting possibility of designing, producing and testing meso-optics of arbitrary 3D shapes, is within reach with gray-scale technology.  Application of gray scale technology to Sandia's LIGA foundry process as well as meso-optics for redirecting ARC emission is totally new.<br/><br/>This is a collaborative project between UCSD and Yale.  Yale (ADS and RKC) will be responsible in defining the shapes, sizes and materials of ARCs to be fabricated.  UCSD (SHL) will be responsible for the fabrication of ARCs and sample examination.  Yale (RKC) will measure the fabricated ARCs in terms of their performance and provide feedback to the Yale design group and to the fabrication group at UCSD, while focusing on possible application to the integrated optics field and WDM part of the telecommunications field.<br/>***<br/><br/>", "similar_id": [21015, 55830, 55992], "weight": [0.036573611199855804, 0.040567394345998764, 0.9228589534759521], "similar_title": ["Novel Synthesis of Si/Ge-Based Magnetic Semiconductor Films and Heterostructures", "Physics of Strong Disorder and Correlation", "Fundamental Investigation and Development of Screw Dislocation-Driven Nanowire Growth"], "similar_abstract": ["<br/>The proposed activities of this award focus on exploring MBE synthesis of high quality, promising Si/Ge-based magnetic semiconductor epitaxial films and heterostrucutres.

It is known that many important phenomena in materials science originate from the strong repulsion between electrons in solids.  These include all of magnetism, metal-insulator transitions and, more recently, superconductivity.  A particularly exciting recent development is the discovery of materials which are candidates for the long sought quantum spin liquid.  In these systems the electrons are localized by correlation but their spins do not form an ordered state down to the lowest temperature due to quantum fluctuations.  Past theoretical work has predicted that many novel phenomena may emerge at low temperatures, such as specific heat and thermal conductivity which behave like metals in these materials which are charge insulators.  These predictions have recently been observed experimentally.  The plan is to build on the past success to achieve a deeper understanding of this novel phenomenon.  Theory will be developed which aims to explain in detail the experimental observations and to predict new ones.  It is possible that an understanding of the quantum spin liquid will pave the way towards an understanding of the high temperature superconductors, especially in the under doped region, where the formation of quantum spin liquids may be the driving force behind the many anomalous properties observed there.  Theoretical work on the high temperature superconductors will be pursued armed with new insights gained from the studies of quantum spin liquids.  Progress on these long standing problems represent a new paradigm and will have strong impact on condensed matter physics and materials science.<br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education in condensed matter physics.  The theoretical work takes it inspiration from experimental discovery in new materials and aims to explain and predict novel phenomena.  Such novel phenomena often arise in materials where electrons are strongly interacting with each other, and this work will focus on this rich arena.  Past examples include Nobel winning discoveries such as the fractional quantum Hall effect and high temperature superconductivity.  This research area is particularly well suited for the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows because both mathematical sophistication and an understanding of real materials are required to make progress.", "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project supported by Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program seeks to develop the rational design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) nanowire materials whose growth is driven by screw dislocations and to investigate their fundamental characteristics. Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage.

The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy.

"0000172<br/>Popel<br/>The amount and rate of accumulation of biological information is increasing exponentially. The importance of this information explosion cannot be understated - it has transformed the nature of both biology and medicine, and has led many to claim that biology has become an information science. There is, however, growing recognition that the tabulation of genetic and molecular building blocks from which biological systems are composed is not sufficient for understanding the functions of these complex systems. Rather, it is becoming clear that the emergent, integrative behaviors of biological systems are a result of regulated interactions among all the components that form complex structures with specific properties, and that knowledge of each system component, however detailed, is not sufficient by itself to understand these integrative behaviors. Achieving an understanding of molecules, cells, tissues and organs as integrative entities is the next major frontier of biomedical science. Because of the inherent complexity of real biological systems, the development and analysis of information-based computational models is necessary to achieve this understanding.<br/><br/>The objective of the workshop is to bring together researchers who are developing experimentally-based computational models of biological systems spanning hierarchical levels of analysis that include: a) regulation of gene expression; b) sub-cellular and cellular dynamics; and c) tissue and organ function. The meeting will provide a forum for presentation of the state-of-the-art in modeling research, allow for assessment of the degree to which an integrative understanding of system function is being achieved by existing models, and help to identify new areas of high growth potential for the next generation of models.

Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 1184, "graph": {"paper_cite_paper":

depletion.  The project will be part ol'the Polar Sunrise Experiment-2000 (PSE2000) with three main objectives: To investigate and quatitfy the ozone depletion due to surface (snowpack) bases processes. To define the vertical transport of ozone from the stable marine boundary layer to the underlying snowpack. To specify the ocean to atmosphere exchange of lieat, water vapor and after ozone depletion episodes.<br/><br/>               <br/>During February - May 2000, a series of surface- and airborne-based measurements will be undertaken at two experimental sites, at Alert and Williams Island. The Principal Investigator will attempt for the first time to determine in situ ozone fluxes to the snowpack using the eddy covariance and will test the hypothesis that accumulation of ozone reactive materials on and or inside the snowpack contribute to boundary layer ozone destruction during the Polar sunrise. He surmises that processes occurring within the snowpack may explain important missing details in ozone depletion mechanisms.  To verify if the snowpack constitutes a sink for ozone, detailed measurements will be made in the interstitial air within the snowpack.  Gas-phase measurements at five depths, from the surface to 100-150 cm, will be achieved through air sampling with chamber systems, coupled with highly sensitive ozone analyzers.  During spring Arctic ozone depletion episodes, the atmospheric column extending from the surface to about 300 meters (m) can be devoid of ozone.  Above the 300-meter level, the height of the capping inversion of the mixed layer, ozone mixing ratios can exceed 40 ppbv.  This ozone reservoir can serve as a source of surface ozone via downward transport by turbulent eddies.  Because the Arctic troposphere is dark for several months, the atmospheric boundary layer is stable and stratified, thus preventing atmospheric vertical mixing.  Therefore, photochnmically reactive chemical species may accumulate in the boundary layer and become available to partake in reactions when sunlight resumes.  He will investigate the role of ocean to atmosphere exchange of energy and momentum on the chemical composition of the boundary layer by defining the individual components of the energy balance for the camp surface.  The data set will be used in the development and validation of numerical modeling systems to understand the atmosphere-ocean energy exchange capacity at the ice-camp site, thereby characterizing the availability of activation energy for local chemical reactions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>", "similar_id": [29101, 64618, 53751], "weight": [0.0017164263408631086, 0.001957082422450185, 0.9963265061378479], "similar_title": ["Collaborative Research:    DIMES, Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing in the Southern Ocean", "Collaborative Research:  RUI: Orogenic Exhumation and Neogene Foreland Basin Evolution, Central Andes", "Collaborative Research:  Type 1: LOI: L02170303: Arctic Climate Response to Decadal Changes in Radiative Forcing from Aerosols and Ozone"], "similar_abstract": ["<br/>The overturning circulation of the ocean plays a governing role in the earth's climate because of the enormous capacity of the ocean to hold heat and carbon dioxide. The Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica, plays a disproportionate role in this overturning circulation because this is one of the main areas where deep waters rise to the surface to exchange heat and carbon dioxide with the atmosphere. Although the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) system brings deep water to the surface, dynamical constraints inhibit meridional exchanges. Ocean eddies are believed to play a dominant role in transporting water south across the ACC above deep ridges, feeding water driven northward by the intense winds. The extent to which this Isopycnal circulation is \"short-circuited\" by mixing across density layers is important to climate models but is unknown.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Conceptual models of global meridional overturning and numerical predictions for future climate are strongly sensitive to the methods used to represent mixingalong and across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), where isopycnals are steeply tilted. Neither diapycnal nor isopycnal mixing has been measured in the Southern Ocean in a systematic way. The goals of the Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES) are to measure eddy mixing along density surfaces in the subsurface ocean (isopycnal mixing), and across those density layers (diapycnal mixing), and to determine how those processes depend on the larger scale dynamics of the ocean, so that they can be properly represented in numerical models of ocean circulation and of climate. To reveal these processes at work in the ACC, a chemical tracer and 75 floats that follow the water along isopycnal surfaces will be released in the ACC near 1300 m depth, 60 S, and 110 W, early in 2008. Floats that measure fine-structure T, S, and velocity within and above the tracer cloud will be released at the same time. The floats and tracer will be carried by the ACC over the relatively smooth bottom of the SE Pacific, spreading both across and along the current as they travel. After a year, the leading edge of the tracer will just start to pass over the ridges of Drake Passage into the Scotia Sea. Another 75 isopycnal floats will be released near the center of the tracer patch at this time. Trajectories of the floats, measured acoustically with an array of sound sources, will be used to study and to measure isopycnal dispersion. Spreading of the tracer will give integrated measures of both isopycnal and diapycnal dispersion. The eddy field, and its vertical structure, will be studied with sea surface height measured by satellite altimeters, and with hydrographic profiles taken from research vessels and from autonomous instruments<br/>drifting with the tracer. Turbulent dissipation, from which diapycnal mixing can be estimated, will be measured with ship-based free-falling profilers to study the spatial and temporal scales of the mixing and to examine suspected hot spots of mixing. Shear driving this mixing will be measured with the free-falling profilers and with special floats drifting with the tracer and floats that profile between the surface and the tracer layer.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: DIMES will deploy a variety of instruments including microstructure and finestructure profilers and and isopycnal-following autonomous floats, some for the first time in Southern Ocean. The mixing results will be made available to aid in improving representations of mixing in climate models. In addition, profiling DIMES floats will augment the Argo database for the Southern Ocean. The project will involve a postdoctoral investigator, graduate students at Florida State University and Scripps Institution of Oceanography and will offer research opportunities to one to two undergraduates per year. <br/><br/>This project is a contribution to the U.S. CLIVAR (CLImate VARiability and predictability) program.<br/>", "Synorogenic Neogene foreland basins of the southern Central Andes (32-35 degrees S) provide a sensitive, but poorly constrained, record of the spatial and temporal patterns of tectonics, magmatism and orogenic exhumation across this classic convergent continental arc system. Basin evolution is strongly influenced by the segmentation of the Nazca plate: North of 33 degrees S, the subducting slab is subhorizontal, producing basement-involved thick-skinned contractional deformation, a broken foreland, and sparse magmatism; south of 33 degrees S, the subducting slab attains a normal subduction angle, with episodic magmatic activity, thin-skinned structural deformation and development of stacked piggy back basins. Segmentation of the margin into flat, transitional and normal slab segments produces longitudinal variations in arc magmatism, structural deformation and basin development that provide an ideal laboratory to examine contrasting along-strike patterns of orogenic exhumation and basin evolution. The primary objective of this investigation is to document the temporal-spatial pattern in Neogene orogenic exhumation and its relation to structural deformation, topographic evolution, basin development and sediment dispersal patterns in the southern Central Andes (32-35 degrees S). More specifically, this investigation will examine the relationship of spatial and temporal distribution of synorogenic foreland basins to variation in slab dip, the variation in pattern and rate of orogenic exhumation along strike, and the control of pre-existing basement configuration on orogenic exhumation and basin development. A systematic field-based research program will integrate isotopic analyses of detrital zircon (U-Pb, Hf, (U-Th)/He) with stratigraphic analysis, whole rock geochemistry and apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronology to constrain the timing, episodicity, provenance, depositional architecture and subsidence rate of Neogene synorogenic basins.<br/><br/>The south-central Andes Mountains provides an ideal laboratory to examine the dynamic linkage between the rate and magnitude of orogenic exhumation and the spatial and temporal pattern of adjacent basin development. Understanding this linkage will provide insight into the use of basinal stratigraphy to constrain the magnitude and rate of tectonic uplift in seismically active regions, the evaluation of the accumulation and preservation of economic resources and the accurate reconstruction of earth history. The project is tightly integrated with two international (Argentina, Chile, France, and United States) multidisciplinary regional-scale investigations studying Neogene crustal dynamics along three cross-Andean transects (32-35 degrees S). Students and faculty from University of Wisconsin Eau Claire and San Diego State University will collaborate closely with these groups in field and laboratory work and joint publications. Research in Argentina will be integral in interdisciplinary experiential learning activities at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire. The project is supported by the Tectonics Program and the Office of International & Integrative Affairs.", "Current general circulation models (GCMs) have difficulty reproducing the rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss observed over the past decades. One possible factor is that they do not properly represent the radiative forcings from aerosols and tropospheric ozone that could be particularly important in the Arctic. This EaSM Type 1 project will develop an improved understanding of the distributions and decadal trends of aerosols and ozone in the Arctic, including black carbon (BC) deposition fluxes and albedo effects for snow and sea ice, and will study the implications for Arctic climate change over the 1980-2010 period. It will build an interdisciplinary partnership between atmospheric chemists using the GEOS-Chem CTM and cryosphere scientists using CCSM4, to better describe aerosol-chemistry-climate interactions in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The project will take advantage of intensive observations during the International Polar Year (IPY) to test and improve the GEOS-Chem representation of aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes in the Arctic. A 30-year GEOS-Chem simulation (1980-2010) with evolving sources from human activity and fires will be conducted and evaluated against long-term records. Aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes from GEOS-Chem will be input to CCSM4 to simulate Arctic radiative forcing and climate response over the 30-year period. Ensemble sensitivity simulations conducted with CCSM4 will diagnose the perturbations to temperature, sea ice, and atmospheric circulation associated with these radiative forcings. Knowledge gained from this project will be used to evaluate the simulation of Arctic aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and BC deposition fluxes within CESM. Fully coupled aerosol-chemistry-climate simulations of the 1980-2010 period will be conducted in CESM to assess Arctic climate response from aerosols and ozone and to investigate climate feedbacks.  This project will also provide policy analysts with information on the role of aerosols and tropospheric ozone in driving Arctic climate change.

"The proposed research to be undertaken will continue and extend a long-standing program of research in nonlinear econometric methods. The view is that an econometric specification is an approximation to the underlying data generating mechanism. In keeping with this view, methodologies have been developed that sequentially improve the approximation as information becomes available, and permit reliable inference at each intermediate stage of model evolution. These objectives have been accomplished at a level of generality that encompasses most nonlinear econometric inference procedures. The basic idea is to endow a procedure with nonparametric properties by replacing the structural model with a truncated series expansion, the error density with a truncated expansion, or both. By letting the truncation point grow adaptively with sample size, the approximation is accurate enough at each intermediate stage to permit reliable inference and ultimate convergence to the underlying data generating mechanism is assured.<br/>Tightly parameterized structural modeling can be carried out within this paradigm. The idea is to require that moments implied by the structural model match the scores of a model developed according to the methodology described above. This estimator has certain advantages. Estimates can be made as efficient as if maximum likelihood had been employed. Unlike maximum likelihood, the computational burden does not increase if the state vector is partially observed either because the structural model contains latent variables or because data is missing. Studentized scores serve as diagnostic tests and, because the scores correspond to identifiable features of data, failure to pass a diagnostic indicates which features of data a tightly parameterized structural model cannot explain. This is an invaluable aid to model development.<br/>The specific proposal is to establish that the advantages claimed above follow from assumptions that are more primitive than the high level assumptions used to date, to improve computational efficiency, and to continue an ongoing program of empirical work that exploits the new methodologies discussed above. Initial work will focus on the estimation of structural macro models with attention to the simultaneous use of time series and panel data. Reduced form applications will focus on methods for extracting the continuous time volatility process from discretely sampled asset prices and efficiently predicting functionals of the continuous time process such as integrated forward volatility.<br/><br/>", "similar_id": [55992, 29345, 50010], "weight": [0.26530876755714417, 0.3673456311225891, 0.3673456311225891], "similar_title": ["Fundamental Investigation and Development of Screw Dislocation-Driven Nanowire Growth", "Nonlinear Model Updating Using Ambient Responses For Damage Diagnosis In Concrete Structures", "Nonlinear Model Updating Using Ambient Responses For Damage Diagnosis In Concrete Structures"], "similar_abstract": ["TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project supported by Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program seeks to develop the rational design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) nanowire materials whose growth is driven by screw dislocations and to investigate their fundamental characteristics. Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers.", "Abstract: <br/><br/>The focus of the research is on the development of a reliable method to update nonlinear finite element models of concrete structures to represent the damaged state of the structure. Ambient responses, combined with an understanding of the structure?s fundamental hysteretic behavior, will be used to generate the updated nonlinear finite element model. Such updated models are essential for determining the remaining lifetime of these structures and identifying repair/replacement priorities. Current global, vibration-based techniques have the ability to accurately identify linear elastic stiffness parameters for an appropriately defined identification model through ambient testing. However, existing damage diagnosis techniques are primarily limited to linear models in which the stiffness of some of the elements is reduced to represent damage by relating it to the change in the modal characteristics of the structure. The primary goals of the research efforts include: gaining an understanding of the fundamental behaviors of this class of structures; developing experimentally-verified, improved nonlinear constitutive models for civil engineering structures that can capture the salient features of the hysteretic response; developing a method for the assessment of the condition of a damaged structure when the elastic stiffness has deteriorated; validating the proposed methodology to relate structural damage to changes in elastic stiffness, resulting in a model that will be able to predict the capacity. Degradation in the elastic stiffness of the structure will be related to a reduced set of damage parameters that identify the state of the constitutive models in the nonlinear finite element model. Parametric identification models will be constructed appropriately to relate the damage parameters to the reduced initial stiffness values based on ambient response measurements. Currently available modal identification and parameter identification techniques based on ambient vibration responses will be employed and improved for determination of elastic stiffness parameters. <br/><br/>", "Abstract: <br/><br/>The focus of the research is on the development of a reliable method to update nonlinear finite element models of concrete structures to represent the damaged state of the structure.

This study examines how people and organizations in this industry work and how this work adapts and is affected by the use of ICT. Since real estate agents act as transactional intermediaries, this industry is affected by a shift to electronic transactions and the potential disintermediation this implies. Since many industries are shifting towards more information/knowledge-based structures, understanding how ICT use is changing this industry will provide empirical evidence about potential changes that might be expected in other industries. The study has three objectives: 1. Describe how the use of ICT changes the ways individual knowledge workers conduct their work; 2. Describe organizational and industrial changes related to the use of ICT; 3. Describe how changes in individual work relate to changes in organizational and industrial structures and processes. At the individual level, the researchers focus on changes in work design and social capital. At the organization and industry levels, ideas from transaction cost and coordination theory are applied.", "similar_id": [41339, 37749, 33324], "weight": [0.10912328958511353, 0.42937079071998596, 0.4615059494972229], "similar_title": ["SGER Collaborative Research:  VisualizeIT - Measuring the Impact of IT-Enabled Concept Generation on Designer Creativity", "Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference", "CPA (Gr&Vis): Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2007 Conference"], "similar_abstract": ["This project creates and evaluates new visualization techniques of models from a concept generator to stimulate the designer to generate concepts not originally posed by designer or computer. This technology is expected to enable the development of creative solutions to design problems that would otherwise go undiscovered. The three challenges to achieving effective visualization for enhancing creative design at the concept generation phase are: 1) how to cluster the many concept variants returned from an automated concept generation algorithm into a manageable set of representative concepts that spans the design alternative space; 2) how to visually represent the option space to the designer so that it enhances creativity; and 3) how to measure the impact of the visualization schemes on designer creativity.

The goal of his research is to reconstruct prehistoric Mayan ritual practice and examine the potential continuity between ancient and post contact periods. While early Spanish manuscripts provide extensive descriptions of multiple aspects of Mayan life, it is uncertain to what extent these are biased by European preconceptions. According to Spanish accounts the Mayan worldview included the hot/cold dichotomy and, supposedly, Mayans believed that good health resulted from an appropriate balance of the two. Illness, they believed was the result of a preponderance of \"cold\" and to remedy this people entered ritual sweat baths to increase the amount of \"hot\" in their body. As Dr. Child notes, this concept is surprisingly close to the European \"four humors\" belief and there is reason to doubt its prehistoric Mayan existence. Through archaeological excavation at the site of Piedras Negras in Guatemala Mr. Child will attempt to reconstruct sweat bath ritual.<br/><br/>While several examples of sweat baths are known from other Middle American sites, Piedras Negras is unique in the number it contains. Eight have been identified and excavation to date indicates that their sequential construction spans the occupation of this major site. However adjoining rooms appear to have been built over a relatively short period of time. Based on his prior work at the site, Mr. Child believes it is possible to reconstruct how sweat baths were used since they contain a wealth of artifacts including carefully crafted obsidian (volcanic glass blades) and pumice stones. \"Hot/cold\" is only one of many dicotomys attributed to the prehistoric Maya and through careful mapping, excavation and plotting of excavated remains it should be possible to determine where activities and gendered use of the sweatbaths were divided along such lines.<br/><br/>This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many Middle Americanist archaeologists. It will shed light on the long-term continuity of tradition over time and help determine whether specific concepts are primarily historical in nature or reflect more basic aspects of the human mind. This award will also assist in training a promising young scientist.<br/>", "similar_id": [71668, 72818, 58428], "weight": [0.13292914628982544, 0.31851086020469666, 0.5485600233078003], "similar_title": ["RET in Engineering and Computer Science SITE: Research Experience for Teachers on Cyber-Enabled Technologies", "Collaborative Research:   Proterozoic Mountain Building and Collapse, Eastern Adirondacks, New York", "EFRI-M3C: A Hybrid Control Systems Approach to Brain-Machine Interfaces for Exoskeleton Control"], "similar_abstract": ["Developing computational-thinking competencies in K-12 schools to prepare students to join the 21st Century workforce is a critical need.

Research projects target emerging cyber-enabled technologies including cloud computing, social networks, security and privacy. An important objective of the program is the transfer of the teachers' research experiences into the classrooms. Teachers work closely with faculty, staff, students and each other to collectively explore methodologies to effectively communicate the technologies and the research concepts and processes to students, identify and link these skills across the curricula, and design educational modules based on technology and research gains resulting from the RET experience. Other career development program activities include weekly seminars, field trips, workshops and faculty mentorship throughout academic year and beyond as the collaboration matures.", "Rocks of the Adirondack Mountains of New York represent a large dome-shaped uplift of the Precambrian basement of North America. These rocks record the assembly and breakup of the supercontinent, \"Rodinia\" that formed approximately 1 billion years ago. The formation and dispersal of this continent may have played a role in the evolution of life on Earth, the evolution of climate and the production of a snowball Earth, and in the development of important economic resources, including Rare Earth Element deposits. New data are significantly changing our understanding of the history of the Adirondack uplift. A major period of mountain-building, the 1180 million year Shawinigan orogeny, was previously unrecognized in the region, and one challenge involves recognizing and distinguishing the effects of this tectonism compared to the 1050 Million year Ottawan orogeny that was previously thought to dominate the geology of this region. The latest stages in the geologic history of the Adirondacks involved intrusion of extensive granite (\"Lyon Mountain granite\") and the development of shear zones that were important in the collapse of the mountains and in the uplift of the basement rocks. This research will involve modern structural, petrologic, and geochronologic analysis to characterize the geologic and tectonic history of the eastern Adirondack region, and further our understanding of mid crustal processes during mountain building and collapse. This work represents a new collaboration between the University of Massachusetts and Castleton State College, a predominantly undergraduate state college nearly adjacent to the Adirondack field area. In addition to the PIs, the research team will consist of undergraduates from Castleton State College and a graduate student from the University of Massachusetts. The graduate student will serve as a mentor for undergraduates from Castleton and a link between the two institutions. The collaboration will provide an ideal base for field research during all seasons of the year and it will provide access for Castleton undergraduates to a predominantly undergraduate state college nearly adjacent to the Adirondack field area. In addition to the PIs, the research team will consist of undergraduates from Castleton State College and a graduate student from the University of Massachusetts. The graduate student will serve as a mentor for undergraduates from Castleton and a link between the two institutions. The collaboration will provide an ideal base for field research during all seasons of the year and it will provide access for Castleton undergraduates to a research-oriented university and to research equipment. Finally, the eastern Adirondack Mountains are a popular destination for hiking, camping, and vacations. Student researchers will work to develop outreach materials and programs about the geology of the spectacular northeastern Adirondack region.<br/><br/>This research tests the hypothesis that there is a regionally extensive shear zone in the eastern Adirondacks in the vicinity of Whitehall, New York that accommodated the eastward unroofing of the Adirondack Mountains during orogenic collapse shortly after the culmination of the Ottawan orogenic event (ca. 1050 Ma).  Preliminary in-situ monazite ages constrain the extensional shearing to 1050-1026 Ma, similar to those reported for the extensional movement on the Carthage-Colton shear zone in the NW Adirondacks. These data suggest that orogenic collapse following the Ottawan orogeny resulted in the formation of a two-sided metamorphic core complex or gneiss dome structure. This project will utilize in-situ high resolution monazite geochronology, in conjunction with detailed field mapping, structural and kinematic analysis, and metamorphic petrology in order to characterize the extent, kinematics, and timing of East Adirondack shearing and to integrate the shear zone into the overall tectonic history of the Adirondack Mountains. The Grenville orogen marks the culminating collision in the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. Post-collisional collapse of the Himalayan-scale Grenville orogen signaled the start of a new phase of rifting, passive margin development, and in the broadest sense, the Appalachian Wilson cycle. Major changes have been proposed in the character and age of tectonic events involved in the construction and collapse of the orogen. With the coming of Earthscope-US-Array and GeoPrisms it is critical to evaluate new models for this orogen that may have had a controlling influence on the geometry and character of the proto-Atlantic margin. The proposed research will involve detailed field mapping and structural/petrographic analysis in order to establish a chronologic framework for the development and overprinting relationships of fabrics and metamorphic mineral assemblages. Rocks related to each of the major stages of Adirondack orogenesis (Elsevirian, Shawinigan, AMCG plutonism, Ottawan, etc) are all in close proximity in the eastern Adirondacks. The project involves the use of thermobarometry and psuedosection analysis to delineate the Pressure-Temperature evolution of the crust during the orogenic events with particular focus on the late-stage shearing. A major portion of the work will involve in-situ monazite geochronology in order to place timing constraints on all parts of the history. Our ultimate goal is to place new constraints on the tectonic history of the Grenville Orogen, especially on the collapse and exhumation stages, and also to add to the evolving understanding of monazite behavior during metamorphism and deformation. This work will help to place the Adirondack massif within the context of gneiss domes and provide evidence about the role that this dome played in the collapse and exhumation of the orogen.", "This interdisciplinary research proposal brings together leaders in neurophysiology and brain-machine interfaces (BMI), control systems, and exoskeleton design to significantly advance our understanding of fundamental principles in the neural control of movement in scenarios that involve physical interactions with the world. Furthermore, this work will transform neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life for a large number of neurological patients. The central question that motivates this proposal is: Does the brain use motor programs to help it control a highly redundant multi-degree of freedom (DOF) biomechanical plant such as the arm? To answer this question, this project will conduct a series of experiments that require a combination of three major innovations at the experimental (BMI), theoretical (hybrid control), and technical (exoskeleton design) level. This proposal aims to synthesize all three innovations into a new experimental paradigm unifying brain, biomechanics, and behavior. Specifically, visually-cued motor plans in the motor cortices of macaque monkeys will be: 1) read by a BMI, 2) interpreted by a hybrid controller and a musculoskeletal model, and 3) translated into appropriate movements and stiffness in a multi-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>At a societal level, this proposal seeks to create a significant advancement in neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from paralysis due to lesions of the central nervous system or other neurological disorders. BMIs will make a great impact in the quality of life for neurological patients by providing reliable performance when interacting with real objects and in real-world scenarios. This proposal also informs motor systems neuroscience by proposing a novel framework to study how neural ensembles can learn to control a multi-DOF exoskeleton by volitional modulation of neural activity in real-world tasks. It provides a critical link between neural events and real-world dynamics through a novel hierarchical distributed control scheme for hybrid systems identification and control that captures the continuous time evolution of the arm/exoskeleton, as well as the dynamically changing sequence of tasks. No motor task of this complexity has ever been demonstrated in a BMI system. The potential impact of the proposed work is immense. If successful, this work will transform our understanding about how the brain controls movement, and will introduce a paradigm shift in the development of the next generation of neural prosthetics that will restore motor function in millions of neurologically impaired patients ? a development which may very well impact other domains such as human-machine interaction and innovative user interfaces. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The dissemination of data and research findings from this project will be done through a project website. Our codes will be open source, and the methods, algorithms and results will be available through publications in the fields of neuroscience, control and robotics. Through the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at Berkeley, research results from this program will be immediately accessible and distributed to a large engineering community, in particular other interdisciplinary research groups. Also, the findings in the proposed research will be outreached to K-12 students and their parents through various activities at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS), such as CAL-day. In addition, research findings will be disseminated through workshops at the main annual conferences in neuroscience, robotics, control, and biomedical engineering. The educational component of this proposal relies on BMI as a platform for interdisciplinary education in science and engineering. New graduate-level courses will be introduced and existing courses will be enhanced based on results of this project. The proposed efforts will open doors to student rotations between neuroscientists, control theorists and roboticists. In addition to postdocs and graduate students, undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the project: modeling, analysis, simulation, prototype development and experimentation. Special effort will be placed on the recruitment of individuals from underrepresented groups including women, thereby building on the strong record the PIs have in this area."], "person": 57450,

The transduction of mechanical force into biological response occurs at many length scales, ranging from the molecular to the macroscopic.  This Workshop will examine mechanisms of force transduction that span these multiple length scales.  Or particular interest are hierarchical aspects of force transduction, or common themes that may unify concepts at the cellular, sub-cellular, tissue, organ and organism levels.  Also important are specific force-response events that may occur within the cell, between cells, among tissues, etc.  The major themes of the conference will be (1) force transduction at the molecular, cellular tissue, and organism levels, (2) relations between molecular structure and mechanical properties, and (3) relations between mechanical forces and biological function.  The Workshop is interdisciplinary and is intended to encourage and facilitate communication at the Physics/Biology interface.  Participants come from a wide range of disciplines, including bioengineering, biology, mathematics, physics, and the neural sciences.  Support will be provided for younger faculty and advanced graduate students.  The results of the workshop will be presented in a Workshop Report, which will be discuss opportunities and challenges in the general area of force transduction in biology.<br/>%%%<br/>This award provides support for an NSF-sponsored Workshop on Force Transduction in Biology, to be held in Arlington, VA, July 24-26.

It is known that many important phenomena in materials science originate from the strong repulsion between electrons in solids.  These include all of magnetism, metal-insulator transitions and, more recently, superconductivity.  A particularly exciting recent development is the discovery of materials which are candidates for the long sought quantum spin liquid.  In these systems the electrons are localized by correlation but their spins do not form an ordered state down to the lowest temperature due to quantum fluctuations.  Past theoretical work has predicted that many novel phenomena may emerge at low temperatures, such as specific heat and thermal conductivity which behave like metals in these materials which are charge insulators.  These predictions have recently been observed experimentally.  The plan is to build on the past success to achieve a deeper understanding of this novel phenomenon.  Theory will be developed which aims to explain in detail the experimental observations and to predict new ones.  It is possible that an understanding of the quantum spin liquid will pave the way towards an understanding of the high temperature superconductors, especially in the under doped region, where the formation of quantum spin liquids may be the driving force behind the many anomalous properties observed there.  Theoretical work on the high temperature superconductors will be pursued armed with new insights gained from the studies of quantum spin liquids.  Progress on these long standing problems represent a new paradigm and will have strong impact on condensed matter physics and materials science.<br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education in condensed matter physics.  The theoretical work takes it inspiration from experimental discovery in new materials and aims to explain and predict novel phenomena.  Such novel phenomena often arise in materials where electrons are strongly interacting with each other, and this work will focus on this rich arena.  Past examples include Nobel winning discoveries such as the fractional quantum Hall effect and high temperature superconductivity.  This research area is particularly well suited for the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows because both mathematical sophistication and an understanding of real materials are required to make progress.", "This interdisciplinary research proposal brings together leaders in neurophysiology and brain-machine interfaces (BMI), control systems, and exoskeleton design to significantly advance our understanding of fundamental principles in the neural control of movement in scenarios that involve physical interactions with the world. Furthermore, this work will transform neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life for a large number of neurological patients. The central question that motivates this proposal is: Does the brain use motor programs to help it control a highly redundant multi-degree of freedom (DOF) biomechanical plant such as the arm? To answer this question, this project will conduct a series of experiments that require a combination of three major innovations at the experimental (BMI), theoretical (hybrid control), and technical (exoskeleton design) level. This proposal aims to synthesize all three innovations into a new experimental paradigm unifying brain, biomechanics, and behavior. Specifically, visually-cued motor plans in the motor cortices of macaque monkeys will be: 1) read by a BMI, 2) interpreted by a hybrid controller and a musculoskeletal model, and 3) translated into appropriate movements and stiffness in a multi-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>At a societal level, this proposal seeks to create a significant advancement in neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from paralysis due to lesions of the central nervous system or other neurological disorders. BMIs will make a great impact in the quality of life for neurological patients by providing reliable performance when interacting with real objects and in real-world scenarios. This proposal also informs motor systems neuroscience by proposing a novel framework to study how neural ensembles can learn to control a multi-DOF exoskeleton by volitional modulation of neural activity in real-world tasks. It provides a critical link between neural events and real-world dynamics through a novel hierarchical distributed control scheme for hybrid systems identification and control that captures the continuous time evolution of the arm/exoskeleton, as well as the dynamically changing sequence of tasks. No motor task of this complexity has ever been demonstrated in a BMI system. The potential impact of the proposed work is immense. If successful, this work will transform our understanding about how the brain controls movement, and will introduce a paradigm shift in the development of the next generation of neural prosthetics that will restore motor function in millions of neurologically impaired patients ? a development which may very well impact other domains such as human-machine interaction and innovative user interfaces. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The dissemination of data and research findings from this project will be done through a project website. Our codes will be open source, and the methods, algorithms and results will be available through publications in the fields of neuroscience, control and robotics. Through the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at Berkeley, research results from this program will be immediately accessible and distributed to a large engineering community, in particular other interdisciplinary research groups. Also, the findings in the proposed research will be outreached to K-12 students and their parents through various activities at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS), such as CAL-day. In addition, research findings will be disseminated through workshops at the main annual conferences in neuroscience, robotics, control, and biomedical engineering. The educational component of this proposal relies on BMI as a platform for interdisciplinary education in science and engineering. New graduate-level courses will be introduced and existing courses will be enhanced based on results of this project. The proposed efforts will open doors to student rotations between neuroscientists, control theorists and roboticists. In addition to postdocs and graduate students, undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the project: modeling, analysis, simulation, prototype development and experimentation. Special effort will be placed on the recruitment of individuals from underrepresented groups including women, thereby building on the strong record the PIs have in this area."], "person": 40238,

The goals of the proposed study are to: a) develop innovative testing methodologies to measure interfacial fracture toughness at the meso and microscale levels, b) experimentally demonstrate the loss mechanisms and mode mixity effects on the structural integrity of PZT/Silicon interfaces, and c) formulate a law for the energy release rate and the fracture toughness that account for the materials anisotropy at the PZT/Silicon interface.  In addition, viscous loss mechanisms for the PZT material and the nature of  structural losses for the silicon will be investigated.  <br/><br/>In the educational plan the PI proposes to increase and modernize student involvement in the ongoing research, within and outside the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, by promoting research transfer into classrooms, and simultaneously increasing the number of women represented in engineering.  To increase the gender diversity, the PI will collaborate with Douglass College of Women.  Among other activities, a seminar series, with distinguished women in the field, will be held  in order to attract more women and minorities in engineering. The PI proposes to develop a new course in which she will promote state-of-the-art experimental techniques, modern principles and methods of analysis  used in the study of  MEMS.

Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers.", "The George E.

With support from the NSF Division of Engineering Education and Centers(EEC) and the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation(CMMI), NEESreu students will engage in state-of-the-art experiments using large-scale test facilities involving physical models, computational models, and data analysis to generate new knowledge that advances earthquake and tsunami risk mitigation. Facilities include shake tables, large-scale structural testing systems, geotechnical centrifuges, mobile field laboratories, permanently instrumented geotechnical field stations, and a tsunami wave. Students will collaborate on active NEES research projects, which tackle a breadth of high priority earthquake mitigation issues ranging from performance of the nation's infrastructure (bridges, ports, pipelines, and levees) to innovative strategies for reducing damage and losses to buildings to the interaction of structures and tsunamis. In addition, this NEESreu program will demonstrate advanced methods for preparing engineering students to participate in geographically-distributed research projects using collaboration tools that are becoming common place in research and professional practice. NEESreu students will use the latest IT collaboration tools to form virtual peer teams for supporting each other's research.

The theoretical foundation uses ideas from status characteristics theory to explain women's and men's different conceptions of their competence (under specified conditions), and subsequent occupational aspiration. Predictions from this theory will be tested in a small groups laboratory. The second part of the study examines survey data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of high school students for evidence of the same processes as the experimental research finds. Results will be important for extending an established theory in micro-sociology, as well as for showing some real-world applications of the theoretical principles developed. <br/>", "similar_id": [73469, 33324, 66638], "weight": [0.09763596951961517, 0.7561525106430054, 0.14621156454086304], "similar_title": ["Travel support for DAMOP2014 for US students, June 2-6, 2014", "CPA (Gr&Vis): Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2007 Conference", "Student Travel Support for the CGO 2013, HPCA 2013, and PPoPP 2013 Symposia Co-located in Shenzhen, China"], "similar_abstract": ["This award provides travel support for student participation in the 45th Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (APS-DAMOP) to be held June 2-6, 2014 in Madison, Wisconsin.

This outreach activity helps to broaden the participation of students in research.", "This award will support student travel to three co-located conferences: the International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2013), the International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2013), and the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP 2013). The conferences are being held in Shenzhen, China in February 2013.  These conferences are top-ranked in the fields of architecture, compilers and parallel programming.  Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.  Broader impacts include building the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce."], "person": 8071,

It has been a long-time concern whether one should call a problem with computational complexity Q (n100) 'tractable\".  A commonly accepted explanation is that in practice most problems in P in fact can be solved in time O(n3) or better.  However, recent research has shown that some very important practical problems seem to require algorithms whose complexity is bounded only by very high degree polynomials.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, there are many NP-hard problems, described in a parameterized version, for which it is desired to construct the precise solutions deterministically, while a wide range of applications is only interested in solving these problems with a small or moderate value for the parameters.  The point is how to take advantage of this fact and develop most efficient algorithms for these intractable problems in practice.<br/><br/>The research studies the refinement of the classification of tractability and intractability, based on the recently developed theory of parameterized complexity, with the aim of identifying \"impractical\" polynomial time algorithms and \"efficient\" exponential time algorithms for practical problems.  The following specific issues in algorithm theory are investigated:<br/><br/>developing efficient parameterized algorithms for intractable problems.  This includes two steps:  identifying fixed-parameter tractable problems, and development of most efficient parameterized algorithms for the problems.<br/><br/>identifying \"hard\" polynomial time solvable problems, based on the framework of the W[1]-hardness.  Problems from other practice will also be studied based on this framework.<br/><br/>investigating the relationship between parameterized complexity and approximability.  Parameterized complexity suggests new techniques for proving non-approximability for certain optimization problems that may otherwise be not easy or even impossible based on classical complexity theory.<br/><br/>", "similar_id": [51284, 20462, 7214], "weight": [0.3087628185749054, 0.3456185758113861, 0.3456185758113861], "similar_title": ["CCF- Algorithmic Foundations:  Motion Planning for Geometrically Constrained Structures", "CAREER: Theoretical Studies of the Non-Linear Transport Properties of Molecular Wires", "CAREER: Theoretical Studies of the Non-Linear Transport Properties of Molecular Wires"], "similar_abstract": ["Linkage reconfiguration problems underlie modern mathematical investigations in robotics, mechanical design, structural engineering, and bio-geometry, and have the potential of impacting computational biology, especially the problems emerging from modeling protein folding or, more generally, protein flexibility and motion.<br/><br/>This proposal focuses on the foundations of motion planning approaches to geometrically constrained structures.  The selected problems are part of a long-term program for understanding the combinatorial, rigidity-theoretic, algebraic and algorithmic aspects of a variety of motion planning approaches to geometric reconfiguration questions.  It builds upon the PIs' previous work on: (a) applying concepts from Rigidity Theory to 2-dimensional (2D) linkage reconfiguration problems (such as the Carpenter's Rule problem using pointed pseudo-triangulation), (b)  Combinatorial Rigidity (generalizations of Pebble Game algorithms for 2D-rigidity to other classes of matroidal sparse graphs, computation of rigid and stressed clusters), (c) motion generation (for pseudo-triangulations in 2D and for complex structures with many loops in 3D), and (d) recent results on finding extremal configurations of revolute jointed robotic manipulators. <br/><br/>The proposal aims at developing systematic motion planning approaches, using mathematically proven techniques and exploiting discrete underlying structures of the geometrically constrained systems under investigation.  Examples include expansive motions and pseudo-triangulations, motion and reconfiguration for 3D-structures (linkages, panel-and-hinge and polyhedral structures) and reconfigurations of robot arms towards extremal configurations (minima and maxima), together with a theoretical investigation of their 3D workspace.", "This is a CAREER award which combines research and educational activities.

They will also conduct a statistical study of ENA events observed by the Geotail satellite.  The statistical study will identify trends in the composition of ENA during the course of a magnetic storm.  Comparison of ENA observations between the Geotail and Polar satellites will be made to compare the total ENA intensity at two locations in space.

Dissertation Research:  The Institution of Infrastructure and the Development of Port-Regions", "abstract": "Social scientists long have focused their attention on the structure, function, and impact of institutions.  Recent lines of inquiry have examined patterns of regional growth in terms of differences in institutional configurations across regions.  Some researchers have argued that certain kinds of institutions are more likely to foster innovation, with attention being given to identifying and understanding these institutions.  These lines of inquiry face two related problems; however, as institutionalist perspectives in regional development run the risk of ignoring economic forces extant outside the region, and they tend to be vague about the role of public policy.  This doctoral dissertation research project aims to increase knowledge of how regional differences in institutions simultaneously influence decisions about investments in and the use of seaports as well as the organization of production and distribution activities.  The project seeks to identify the characteristics of institutions (both the formal contractual, organizational, technical and regulatory systems as well as the informal norms, networks and relationships between actors) that are more likely to enhance or promote innovation, the accessing of new markets, and productivity gains.  These issues will be examined through comparative analyses of the different ways that Toyota USA has used nine U.S. ports as integral components of its production and distribution system since 1980.  The research is guided by working hypotheses that innovation-enhancing institutions are characterized by close and multi-layered relationships between private and public actors, that policy can change the character of these institutions, and that they make a difference to regional economic development outcomes.  These hypotheses will be tested through the conduct of interview-based case studies of the ports at Oakland, Long Beach, and Baltimore as well as documentary and quantitative analyses of all nine ports used by Toyota USA.  This project will contribute to the current theoretical debates about the importance of institutions and the relationship between local and global forces in regional development outcomes.  The findings should be of substantial policy relevance, because they will highlight the ways in which public policy choices in institutional design can and do influence certain aspects of regional growth performance.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/>", "similar_id": [72818, 55992, 48629], "weight": [0.22589579224586487, 0.362354576587677, 0.4117496609687805], "similar_title": ["Collaborative Research:   Proterozoic Mountain Building and Collapse, Eastern Adirondacks, New York", "Fundamental Investigation and Development of Screw Dislocation-Driven Nanowire Growth", "CAREER:Language Brokering and Child Adjustment in Mexican American Children"], "similar_abstract": ["Rocks of the Adirondack Mountains of New York represent a large dome-shaped uplift of the Precambrian basement of North America. These rocks record the assembly and breakup of the supercontinent, \"Rodinia\" that formed approximately 1 billion years ago. The formation and dispersal of this continent may have played a role in the evolution of life on Earth, the evolution of climate and the production of a snowball Earth, and in the development of important economic resources, including Rare Earth Element deposits. New data are significantly changing our understanding of the history of the Adirondack uplift. A major period of mountain-building, the 1180 million year Shawinigan orogeny, was previously unrecognized in the region, and one challenge involves recognizing and distinguishing the effects of this tectonism compared to the 1050 Million year Ottawan orogeny that was previously thought to dominate the geology of this region. The latest stages in the geologic history of the Adirondacks involved intrusion of extensive granite (\"Lyon Mountain granite\") and the development of shear zones that were important in the collapse of the mountains and in the uplift of the basement rocks. This research will involve modern structural, petrologic, and geochronologic analysis to characterize the geologic and tectonic history of the eastern Adirondack region, and further our understanding of mid crustal processes during mountain building and collapse. This work represents a new collaboration between the University of Massachusetts and Castleton State College, a predominantly undergraduate state college nearly adjacent to the Adirondack field area. In addition to the PIs, the research team will consist of undergraduates from Castleton State College and a graduate student from the University of Massachusetts. The graduate student will serve as a mentor for undergraduates from Castleton and a link between the two institutions. The collaboration will provide an ideal base for field research during all seasons of the year and it will provide access for Castleton undergraduates to a predominantly undergraduate state college nearly adjacent to the Adirondack field area. In addition to the PIs, the research team will consist of undergraduates from Castleton State College and a graduate student from the University of Massachusetts.

The collaboration will provide an ideal base for field research during all seasons of the year and it will provide access for Castleton undergraduates to a research-oriented university and to research equipment. Finally, the eastern Adirondack Mountains are a popular destination for hiking, camping, and vacations. Student researchers will work to develop outreach materials and programs about the geology of the spectacular northeastern Adirondack region.<br/><br/>This research tests the hypothesis that there is a regionally extensive shear zone in the eastern Adirondacks in the vicinity of Whitehall, New York that accommodated the eastward unroofing of the Adirondack Mountains during orogenic collapse shortly after the culmination of the Ottawan orogenic event (ca. 1050 Ma).  Preliminary in-situ monazite ages constrain the extensional shearing to 1050-1026 Ma, similar to those reported for the extensional movement on the Carthage-Colton shear zone in the NW Adirondacks. These data suggest that orogenic collapse following the Ottawan orogeny resulted in the formation of a two-sided metamorphic core complex or gneiss dome structure. This project will utilize in-situ high resolution monazite geochronology, in conjunction with detailed field mapping, structural and kinematic analysis, and metamorphic petrology in order to characterize the extent, kinematics, and timing of East Adirondack shearing and to integrate the shear zone into the overall tectonic history of the Adirondack Mountains. The Grenville orogen marks the culminating collision in the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. Post-collisional collapse of the Himalayan-scale Grenville orogen signaled the start of a new phase of rifting, passive margin development, and in the broadest sense, the Appalachian Wilson cycle. Major changes have been proposed in the character and age of tectonic events involved in the construction and collapse of the orogen. With the coming of Earthscope-US-Array and GeoPrisms it is critical to evaluate new models for this orogen that may have had a controlling influence on the geometry and character of the proto-Atlantic margin. The proposed research will involve detailed field mapping and structural/petrographic analysis in order to establish a chronologic framework for the development and overprinting relationships of fabrics and metamorphic mineral assemblages. Rocks related to each of the major stages of Adirondack orogenesis (Elsevirian, Shawinigan, AMCG plutonism, Ottawan, etc) are all in close proximity in the eastern Adirondacks. The project involves the use of thermobarometry and psuedosection analysis to delineate the Pressure-Temperature evolution of the crust during the orogenic events with particular focus on the late-stage shearing. A major portion of the work will involve in-situ monazite geochronology in order to place timing constraints on all parts of the history. Our ultimate goal is to place new constraints on the tectonic history of the Grenville Orogen, especially on the collapse and exhumation stages, and also to add to the evolving understanding of monazite behavior during metamorphism and deformation. This work will help to place the Adirondack massif within the context of gneiss domes and provide evidence about the role that this dome played in the collapse and exhumation of the orogen.", "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project supported by Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program seeks to develop the rational design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) nanowire materials whose growth is driven by screw dislocations and to investigate their fundamental characteristics. Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers.", "In this NSF CAREER award, Dr. Kim will examine the academic and socio-emotional development of language brokers (i.e., children who act as translators for their parents), in Mexican immigrant families.  Close to 90% of children in immigrant families perform a language brokering function in their family's resettlement process, taking on the task of translating between the heritage language and English for parents with limited English-speaking skills.  However, scholars have thus far paid little attention to the developmental consequences of being a language broker.  This project on Mexican American families will explore the language brokering experience from multiple perspectives (target child, mother, father).  The goal is to illuminate how language brokering impacts parent-child relationships and, more importantly, how it affects children's adjustment in terms of both academic and socio-emotional outcomes.  Three hundred fifty Mexican American families will be recruited for the project, from schools with a wide range of Latinos in the student population. The study has three research aims: 1) to understand how child language brokering affects parent-child relationships, including any differential effects for mothers and fathers; 2) to investigate how parent-child relationships may be linked to child adjustment in terms of both socio-emotional development and academic outcomes; and 3) to explore how adolescent gender and schools'/neighborhoods' density of Mexican immigrants may influence aims 1 and 2.  This project has the potential to bring to light the effects language brokering may have on the adjustment of the children of Mexican immigrants, the largest and fastest growing minority group in the United States.<br/><br/><br/>This study will examine developmental outcomes for children of Mexican immigrants, a high-risk population with high rates of poverty and low levels of educational attainment. The project aims to understand the mechanisms involved in improving the academic performance of children of immigrants, a growing and significant percentage of America's children, who represent the future of the U.S. workforce.  It also focuses on the developmental period of adolescence, a period of transition in which children are susceptible to developing socio-emotional problems that can compromise school performance.  This research has the potential to identify risk factors that can be used to inform future preventive intervention work with children of immigrants.  Finally, this project will train undergraduate and graduate students who have been traditionally under-represented in the sciences, particularly those of Mexican origin; deliver a curriculum to educate students about the role of immigration, ethnicity, and race in informing child development; and provide workshops, training sessions, and newsletters to educators on the role of language brokering in children's academic functioning."], "person": 3757, "graph": {"paper_cite_paper": [[3, 10, 17, 26, 26, 33, 35, 42, 46, 52, 68, 73, 110, 118, 121, 121, 122, 124, 184, 187, 189, 204, 208,

Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 5711, "graph": {"paper_cite_paper":

a cache storage buffer based upon parametric amplification that will be capable of operating in the Gb/s range, permitting kbits of data to be stored.  We will carry out experiments to explore various ways of reading, writing, and erasing the stored data patterns.  Our work has shown that the ultrafast parametric nonlinearity can be exploited either to provide broad-band tunable gain or dynamic gain modulation for clock-recovery.  We propose to combine the two to demonstrate an optical phase-lock loop, which in principle can be extremely fast as it relies on the Kerr nonlinearity for envelope-phase discrimination.  Such a phase-lock loop will also be wavelength tunable-a feature that is quite important as it adds the function of wavelength conversion to the standard 3R all-optical regenerator.  Simultaneous to the above experimental studies we will also develop numerical models of the various optical systems.  This will provide a design tool to determine the parameter values allowing the most efficient operation of the experimental setups.  We have previously demonstrated the possibility of stably propagating sub-picosecond pulses in fiber lines in which conjugating gain is used to compensate the linear loss.  We propose to assemble a re-circulating loop experiment in which linear loss will be compensated by a pair of non-degenerate parametric (conjugating) amplifiers.  The location of the two amplifiers will be chosen based upon further theoretical/numerical results.  We will experimentally and theoretically study the stability properties of the sub-picosecond pulses by making various signal and noise measurements, and will compare the experimental results directly with numerical simulations.  The proposed experiments will be performed in both the 1550 and 1300 nm wavelength regions in order to demonstrate the wideband capability of parametric amplification.", "similar_id": [7214, 20462, 55992], "weight": [0.04454623535275459, 0.04454623535275459, 0.9109075665473938], "similar_title": ["CAREER: Theoretical Studies of the Non-Linear Transport Properties of Molecular Wires", "CAREER: Theoretical Studies of the Non-Linear Transport Properties of Molecular Wires", "Fundamental Investigation and Development of Screw Dislocation-Driven Nanowire Growth"], "similar_abstract": ["This is a CAREER award which combines research and educational activities.

Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 47225, "graph":

Techniques and results developed in the area have given rise to the consideration that these solution structures can be closely related to neighborhoods in local search heuristics. This project is to investigate such a relationship and, based on which, to develop innovative techniques for the design of effective local search: computational complexity and performance guarantee.<br/><br/>Parameterization on neighborhoods is introduced to scrutinize the relationship between neighborhoods and the computational complexity of local search algorithms. This approach will essentially show what quantities in a sophisticated neighborhood make the algorithms converge fast. It is also expected to demonstrate how difficult in terms of complexity to improve the effectiveness of a simple neighborhood. A systematic technique is also investigated to derive neighborhoods from existing techniques used in parameterized tractibility. This will result in a general framework for the design of effective local search algorithms for various parameterized tractable optimization problems.", "similar_id": [61840, 33324, 37749], "weight": [0.05285530909895897, 0.14033882319927216, 0.8068058490753174], "similar_title": ["Student Travel Support for IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2012", "CPA (Gr&Vis): Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2007 Conference", "Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference"], "similar_abstract": ["Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for the presentation of developments in computer security and electronic privacy, and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field.

Welfare Reform and Neighborhoods: Institutional and Individual Perspectives", "abstract": "For many inner-city neighborhoods, welfare payments play a fundamental role in the local economy and create a measure of stability in everyday life. In such so-called \"welfare neighborhoods,\" local social service providers and service-dependent individuals engage in routine interactions. One facet of these institutional-individual relationships is the nature of the spatial settings within which such interactions occur. Settings like welfare offices, shelters, and sober-living homes are the primary locales where relationships between social welfare institutions and service consumers are forged. Initial cursory examinations indicate that major changes in national social policy, such as the welfare reforms of 1996, are fundamentally altering both the practices of local social welfare institutions and the survival adaptations of service-dependent people. This doctoral dissertation research project will focus on whether welfare reform has reconfigured the settings in which social welfare and other key neighborhood institutions interact with local service-dependent populations. Through the conduct of a case study in the University Park of central Los Angeles, this project will examine how welfare reform, institutional practices, and individual survival patterns work themselves out in particular spatial settings. A two-pronged research design (1) will document changes in the spatial settings of institutional welfare-service delivery under welfare reform, drawing heavily on the USC Welfare Reform Neighborhood Impact Study's large-scale longitudinal survey of 40 local institutions and (2) will use retrospective and bimonthly longitudinal surveys to chart changes in the survival patterns of local service-dependent residents as they negotiate the spatial settings of welfare and other neighborhood services. While focusing on one particular welfare neighborhood, the project results will shed light on processes operating in other welfare neighborhoods in large cities. The project will shed light on the spatial setting of service delivery, a dimension largely missing from previous geographical accounts of the welfare state, and it will explicate ways in which welfare reform is contingent upon the neighborhood context. The project's examination of the concept and reality of \"welfare neighborhood\" will complement urban geographical studies at the city, county and state levels, and the proposed analysis will enrich state-centered studies of social welfare, adding emphasis regarding the role of local institutions and neighborhoods as factors that shape the implementation and the ultimate success of welfare reform. Project results also will provide valuable answers to questions asked by those providing services to dependent individuals.

Close to 90% of children in immigrant families perform a language brokering function in their family's resettlement process, taking on the task of translating between the heritage language and English for parents with limited English-speaking skills.  However, scholars have thus far paid little attention to the developmental consequences of being a language broker.  This project on Mexican American families will explore the language brokering experience from multiple perspectives (target child, mother, father).  The goal is to illuminate how language brokering impacts parent-child relationships and, more importantly, how it affects children's adjustment in terms of both academic and socio-emotional outcomes.  Three hundred fifty Mexican American families will be recruited for the project, from schools with a wide range of Latinos in the student population. The study has three research aims: 1) to understand how child language brokering affects parent-child relationships, including any differential effects for mothers and fathers; 2) to investigate how parent-child relationships may be linked to child adjustment in terms of both socio-emotional development and academic outcomes; and 3) to explore how adolescent gender and schools'/neighborhoods' density of Mexican immigrants may influence aims 1 and 2.  This project has the potential to bring to light the effects language brokering may have on the adjustment of the children of Mexican immigrants, the largest and fastest growing minority group in the United States.<br/><br/><br/>This study will examine developmental outcomes for children of Mexican immigrants, a high-risk population with high rates of poverty and low levels of educational attainment. The project aims to understand the mechanisms involved in improving the academic performance of children of immigrants, a growing and significant percentage of America's children, who represent the future of the U.S. workforce.  It also focuses on the developmental period of adolescence, a period of transition in which children are susceptible to developing socio-emotional problems that can compromise school performance.  This research has the potential to identify risk factors that can be used to inform future preventive intervention work with children of immigrants.  Finally, this project will train undergraduate and graduate students who have been traditionally under-represented in the sciences, particularly those of Mexican origin; deliver a curriculum to educate students about the role of immigration, ethnicity, and race in informing child development; and provide workshops, training sessions, and newsletters to educators on the role of language brokering in children's academic functioning.", "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"<br/><br/>0845934<br/>D. Ramirez<br/><br/>Engineered nanomaterials have unique chemical and physical properties that make them desirable for widespread applications including environmental remediation, energy conversion, catalyst support and biomedical use. Despite their benefits, questions need to be answered about the impacts of such nanomaterials on human health, safety and the environment. Principal objectives of the proposed research are to investigate the transformations of engineered nanomaterials as they interact with hazardous air pollutants in the environment and to determine the efficiency of air pollution control devices to adsorb and desorb pollutants associated with engineered nanomaterials. Systematic research methods and innovative mathematical models based on quantitative-structure activity relationships will be developed to characterize the adsorption and desorption of hazardous air pollutants on engineered nanomaterials. This research project consists of the following main tasks: (1) to characterize the adsorption of hazardous air pollutants on engineered nanomaterials including C60 fullerenes, single- and multi- wall carbon nanotubes, and silica; (2) to examine the effect of humidity and nanomaterial morphology on the atmospheric adsorption and desorption of air pollutants on nanomaterials; (3) to model single- and multi-component sorption based on quantitative-structure activity relationships; and (4) examine the effect of concentration of pollutant associated nanomaterials on their removal efficiency using filtration and adsorption systems. The proposed research plan will be one of the first efforts to evaluate the efficiency of filtration and activated carbon adsorption systems, typically used in industry, for removing specific engineered nanomaterials in the gas phase. The research described in this proposal is novel and potentially transformative in that, if successful, it would lead to new technology for the evaluation of the impacts of hazardous air pollutant-associated engineered nanomaterials on human health, safety and the environment.<br/><br/>As a new Hispanic faculty member in the Environmental Engineering Department at Texas A&M University at Kingsville (TAMUK), a Hispanic-serving institution, the PI will recruit and mentor students from underrepresented groups, and to establish multidisciplinary research and education programs on atmospheric transformations of engineered nanomaterials at TAMUK with national and international collaborations.", "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project supported by Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program seeks to develop the rational design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) nanowire materials whose growth is driven by screw dislocations and to investigate their fundamental characteristics. Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 26630, "graph":

this project is to improve understanding of the kinetics, mechanisms, and products of atmospheric aldehyde (RCHO) reactions.  Aldehyde photolysis plays a crucial role in the formation of photochemical smog and regional ozone, via formation of free radicals such as HCO (formyl radicals) and their subsequent conversion into HO2 and OH radicals.  Photofragmentation quantum yields of aldehydes exhibit dramatic wavelength dependence in the actinic uv region (>290 nm).  Despite the importance of aldehyde photolysis in the chemistry of the troposphere, few wavelength dependent studies of aldehyde photodissociation pathways and quantum yields have been carried out under conditions that can be readily extrapolated to those of the atmosphere.  In this proposal, the photolysis of C3 and C4 aldehydes, pinonaldehyde and caronaldehyde (terpenes oxidation products), and glycidaldehyde and glyoxal (aromatic degradation products) will be studied by combining pulsed laser photolysis with cavity ring-down spectroscopy, FTIR, and mass spectrometry for product characterization.

This EaSM Type 1 project will develop an improved understanding of the distributions and decadal trends of aerosols and ozone in the Arctic, including black carbon (BC) deposition fluxes and albedo effects for snow and sea ice, and will study the implications for Arctic climate change over the 1980-2010 period. It will build an interdisciplinary partnership between atmospheric chemists using the GEOS-Chem CTM and cryosphere scientists using CCSM4, to better describe aerosol-chemistry-climate interactions in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The project will take advantage of intensive observations during the International Polar Year (IPY) to test and improve the GEOS-Chem representation of aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes in the Arctic. A 30-year GEOS-Chem simulation (1980-2010) with evolving sources from human activity and fires will be conducted and evaluated against long-term records. Aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes from GEOS-Chem will be input to CCSM4 to simulate Arctic radiative forcing and climate response over the 30-year period. Ensemble sensitivity simulations conducted with CCSM4 will diagnose the perturbations to temperature, sea ice, and atmospheric circulation associated with these radiative forcings. Knowledge gained from this project will be used to evaluate the simulation of Arctic aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and BC deposition fluxes within CESM. Fully coupled aerosol-chemistry-climate simulations of the 1980-2010 period will be conducted in CESM to assess Arctic climate response from aerosols and ozone and to investigate climate feedbacks.  This project will also provide policy analysts with information on the role of aerosols and tropospheric ozone in driving Arctic climate change.  Two graduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary environmental modeling.", "Technical Summary:<br/>Researchers at the University of California at Davis, USA (UCD) and the Ufa State Aviation Technical University, Ufa, Russia (USATU) will investigate the influence of nanostructuring on the phase transformations and mechanical behavior in beta-Ti alloys.  A variety of materials synthesis and processing techniques including mechanical alloying by cryomilling, spark plasma sintering (SPS), equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) and high pressure torsion (HPT) will be implemented to synthesize nanostructured beta-Ti alloys.  Fundamental information generated will be used to establish the relationship between nanostructuring characteristics, thermal stability, phase transformations, and mechanical response in beta-Ti alloys.  Microstructure characterization studies using advanced diagnostic techniques (i.e., SEM, TEM), will provide an  understanding of the effect of the mechanical alloying, SPS and severe plastic deformation (ECAP/HPT) processing on nanostructural features, and furthermore understanding of fundamental phenomena (e.g., thermal stability, phase transformations and mechanical behavior) associated with nanostructuring in beta-Ti alloys.  Mechanical behavior will be studied to establish the relationship between nanostructural features and mechanical response (i.e., elastic modulus, strength, ductility) in nanostructured beta-Ti alloys.  Implementation of in-situ SEM and TEM mechanical characterization will provide direct observation of the dynamic deformation and microstructural changes in nanostructured beta-Ti alloys.<br/><br/>Non-Technical Summary:<br/>Ti alloys are of scientific and technological interest, and in particular nanostructured beta-Ti alloys may exhibit a high strength with low elastic modulus, which are very attractive for biomedical applications, for example.  The collaborative research program will contribute towards the establishment of a fundamental understanding of the science of nanostructured beta-Ti alloys, as well as providing insight into the fundamental relationships that link alloy composition, microstructure and processing history of nanostructured alloys with mechanical behavior.  The novel approaches to be implemented, based on complementary expertise and resources between University of California at Davis, USA (UCD) and the Ufa State Aviation Technical University, Ufa, will generate comprehensive information that is currently lacking for understanding of the relationship between nanostructuring, phase transformation and mechanical behavior in beta-Ti alloys and beyond.  This, in turn, will ultimately impact the development of Ti materials with potential for applications in the biomedical, aerospace, and automotive industries.  The research activities will help nurture intellectual collaborations and academic exchanges through mutual visits, in particular with participation of students at the graduate and undergraduate levels between UCD and USATU.  This international collaboration will also enrich UCD's outreach program and will involve regional universities, colleges, and K-12.<br/><br/>The project is supported by the Metals and Metallic Nanostructures program and the Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research.", "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project supported by Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program seeks to develop the rational design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) nanowire materials whose growth is driven by screw dislocations and to investigate their fundamental characteristics. Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 35057, "graph":

ARIA will fluidly integrate a humanoid robot, multiple spatially distributed network of cameras, an array of display monitors, as well as a complex but efficient computational face, gaze and gesture detection methodology in order to create a highly flexible and adaptive intelligent environment to potentially advance early joint attention and imitation related skills for young children with ASD. Application of this system will be examined across two user studies with well-defined samples of young children with ASD to provide specific answers and direction to important questions of generalization and potential impact of robotic intervention.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed research advances the design and development of intelligent adaptive robotic platforms to offer a potentially transformative intervention application for young children with ASD. The specific technological innovation proposed here has the potential to significantly contribute to new non-invasive and closed-loop human-robot interaction learning paradigms with potential broad extension to individuals with a vast array of neurodevelopmental conditions and limiting sensory vulnerabilities across the lifespan. From the perspective of the science and technology of robotics, the project will contribute towards the design and development of smart environments for learning, intelligent system architecture for adaptive robotics as well as affective computing and control of dynamic human-robot interaction. In particular, it has the potential to significantly contribute towards developing novel efficient applications of computational methods for affective computing, particularly affective computing mediated by non-invasive gaze and attention processing. It will also contribute towards closed loop gesture-based human-robot interaction by developing new methodologies for gesture recognition and adaptive response from the robot. The project will develop a framework and tools to design adaptive environments for enhanced robotic and embodied social interaction that intelligently and fluidly integrates real-time behavioral indices of attentive and gesture information into flexible and controllable response systems. In short, the proposed activity represents a system has the potential to fundamentally advance the engineering knowledge of intelligent human-robotic interaction. This paradigm may also potently impact our understanding of the science of ASD intervention itself. The embedded user studies will test the potential efficacy of robotic intervention on the earliest core symptoms of ASD.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: With the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prevalence estimates for children with ASD at 1 in 88, effective early identification and treatment is often characterized as a public health emergency. The costs of ASD are thought to be enormous across the lifespan, with recent individual incremental lifetime cost projections exceeding $3.2 million and national cost over $35 billion annually. The proposed research explicitly focuses on realizing robotic intervention technologies with potential for improving early ASD related impairments and could have significant beneficial impact on this population. This research may further a technology that can enable all core components of effective intervention at only a fraction of the cost of typical intervention programs, while at the same time increasing the ability of the intervention provider to systematically control and promote intervention related skills targeting individual deficit. The educational activities will train and mentor undergraduate and graduate students in the proposed research, and bring research into classroom through several courses. The outreach activities will include offering research opportunities to high school students, especially among groups currently underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, and providing high school teachers with research experience during summer. The project offers a strong community connection through formal dissemination to ASD family, clinical, and scientific communities.", "TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. It supports theoretical research and education with the objective to model proton conduction in metal-organic frameworks through the development and application of a novel simulation methodology. Proton conduction in solids and porous materials is a process of fundamental importance for fuel cell technologies. Much of current research on fuel cells focuses on proton exchange membranes where the electrolytes are Nafion or some other sulfonated polymers. Since high proton conductivity is only obtained at high levels of hydration, the maximum operation temperature of current fuel cells is limited by the condensation point of water. Metal-organic frameworks are conceptually different separator materials that can transport protons at high temperatures and in low-humidity environments. One of the main advantages of metal-organic frameworks is the possibility to modify the inner surface of their pores with respect to hydrophilicity and acidity via suitable organic ligands, which can be used to control proton conduction at the molecular level. <br/><br/>This research project focuses on the molecular-level modeling of proton conduction in several chemically and structurally different metal-organic frameworks, all of which are of considerable interest for possible applications in fuel cell technologies. The specific foci are: 1) Proton conduction via water molecules adsorbed in the nanochannels, 2) Proton conduction via nitrogen-containing molecules adsorbed in the nanochannels, 3) Proton conduction in functionalized metal-organic frameworks. Proton conduction presents a challenge for current computational methodologies due to the dynamically changing bonding topologies of numerous molecular structures and complexity of the surrounding chemical environment. A precise characterization of proton conduction requires a physically complete representation of the underlying many-body interactions as well as an extensive sampling of the relevant phase space. The rigorous combination of these two components ultimately leads to the correct description of the free-energy landscape that governs the thermodynamics and kinetics of proton transport. A novel computational approach will be developed that meets this challenge by combining an ab initio-based representation of proton hopping with an accurate description of the framework-framework and framework-guests interactions. This will provide molecular-level insights into the mechanisms that govern proton transport in metal-organic frameworks, which is the first, necessary step toward the rational design of new conducting metal-organic framework structures that can function at higher temperatures and lower relative humidity for application in next generation fuel cells. <br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows will be involved in the research and will acquire a solid foundation in theoretical, physical, and materials chemistry. The computational approach developed within this project will be integrated in Amber, a popular molecular dynamics simulation package. The outreach component also includes the PI's continuing involvement with the Research Scholars Program, which provides high-school students from across the country with the opportunity to carry out summer research at UC San Diego.<br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. It supports an integrated theoretical and computational research and education program related to fuel cell technologies as alternative energy sources. The increasing energy demands and associated effects on the environment pose strict constraints on future use of natural resources such as oil and gas. Considerable effort has recently been devoted to the development of alternative energy sources such as fuel cells that convert chemical energy into directly usable forms. For example, hydrogen fuel cells exploit a fundamental chemical reaction in which the electrons are first drawn from hydrogen molecules to produce protons at the anode, and then are transferred to the cathode through an external circuit that produces direct current. At the same time, the protons are transported across a permeable membrane from the anode to the cathode where they are reunited with the electrons to form molecular hydrogen that subsequently reacts with oxygen to form water. The net result is thus the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy. Since the overall products are water and heat, hydrogen fuel cells are clean technologies with regard to environmental issues. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why fuel cells have not yet found wider application is related to their efficiency, which strongly depends on the ability of protons to quickly travel across the membrane from the anode to the cathode. The particular nature of the membranes that are currently used represent the major obstacle to the development of more efficient fuel cells. The primary goal of this project is to use computer simulation to characterize the molecular mechanisms that determine proton conduction in a new class of materials known as metal-organic frameworks. Metal-organic frameworks contain organic molecules that act as bridges between inorganic clusters to form highly porous three-dimensional structures. Due to the presence of microscopic pores and channels, metal-organic frameworks can thus be used as effective separators in fuel cell technologies in which protons can be shuttled from the anode to the cathode through intervening carrier molecules or through the framework itself.<br/><br/>The proposed project focuses on the molecular-level modeling of proton conduction in several chemically and structurally different metal-organic frameworks, all of which are of considerable interest for possible applications in future fuel cell technologies. In general terms, proton conduction presents an enormous challenge for current computational approaches due to its intrinsic complexity. A new methodology will be developed that meets this challenge by combining state-of-the-art simulation techniques with accurate descriptions of the molecular interactions. The resulting computational approach will be integrated into Amber, which is one of the most popular software packages for molecular dynamics simulations. Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows will be involved in the research and will acquire a solid foundation in theoretical, physical, and materials chemistry. The outreach component of the proposed project also includes the PI continuing involvement with the Research Scholars Program, which provides high-school students from across the country with the opportunity to carry out summer research at UC San Diego.", "This interdisciplinary research proposal brings together leaders in neurophysiology and brain-machine interfaces (BMI), control systems, and exoskeleton design to significantly advance our understanding of fundamental principles in the neural control of movement in scenarios that involve physical interactions with the world. Furthermore, this work will transform neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life for a large number of neurological patients. The central question that motivates this proposal is: Does the brain use motor programs to help it control a highly redundant multi-degree of freedom (DOF) biomechanical plant such as the arm? To answer this question, this project will conduct a series of experiments that require a combination of three major innovations at the experimental (BMI), theoretical (hybrid control), and technical (exoskeleton design) level. This proposal aims to synthesize all three innovations into a new experimental paradigm unifying brain, biomechanics, and behavior. Specifically, visually-cued motor plans in the motor cortices of macaque monkeys will be: 1) read by a BMI, 2) interpreted by a hybrid controller and a musculoskeletal model, and 3) translated into appropriate movements and stiffness in a multi-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>At a societal level, this proposal seeks to create a significant advancement in neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from paralysis due to lesions of the central nervous system or other neurological disorders. BMIs will make a great impact in the quality of life for neurological patients by providing reliable performance when interacting with real objects and in real-world scenarios. This proposal also informs motor systems neuroscience by proposing a novel framework to study how neural ensembles can learn to control a multi-DOF exoskeleton by volitional modulation of neural activity in real-world tasks. It provides a critical link between neural events and real-world dynamics through a novel hierarchical distributed control scheme for hybrid systems identification and control that captures the continuous time evolution of the arm/exoskeleton, as well as the dynamically changing sequence of tasks. No motor task of this complexity has ever been demonstrated in a BMI system. The potential impact of the proposed work is immense. If successful, this work will transform our understanding about how the brain controls movement, and will introduce a paradigm shift in the development of the next generation of neural prosthetics that will restore motor function in millions of neurologically impaired patients ? a development which may very well impact other domains such as human-machine interaction and innovative user interfaces. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The dissemination of data and research findings from this project will be done through a project website. Our codes will be open source, and the methods, algorithms and results will be available through publications in the fields of neuroscience, control and robotics. Through the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at Berkeley, research results from this program will be immediately accessible and distributed to a large engineering community, in particular other interdisciplinary research groups. Also, the findings in the proposed research will be outreached to K-12 students and their parents through various activities at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS), such as CAL-day. In addition, research findings will be disseminated through workshops at the main annual conferences in neuroscience, robotics, control, and biomedical engineering. The educational component of this proposal relies on BMI as a platform for interdisciplinary education in science and engineering. New graduate-level courses will be introduced and existing courses will be enhanced based on results of this project. The proposed efforts will open doors to student rotations between neuroscientists, control theorists and roboticists. In addition to postdocs and graduate students, undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the project: modeling, analysis, simulation, prototype development and experimentation. Special effort will be placed on the recruitment of individuals from underrepresented groups including women, thereby building on the strong record the PIs have in this area."], "person": 19344,

Dissertation Research:  Causes and Consequences of Urban Spatial Patterns of Transitional Land-Market Development in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam", "abstract": "Remarkable changes in national governments over recent decades have had profound impacts on a wide range of institutions.  Although much attention has focused on economic and political systems, nations in transition also have experienced significant changes in human geography, as the factors that influenced the spatial behavior of individuals and groups have been dramatically transformed.  These changes are evident even in nations like Vietnam, where communist regimes retain political control, but major economic reforms unleashed a flurry of land-development activity during the 1990s.  This doctoral dissertation research project will explore how the Vietnamese government's legal and planning efforts to promote development have impacted the practices of private land developers and the spatial patterns of activity in the urban fringe of Ho Chi Minh City.  A combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques will be used to analyze satellite images of land-use change over the last decade and to survey land developers to determine how and why their land-development practices have changed.  Special attention will be given to identifying and analyzing the impact of state policies on land-development processes.  Because development patterns have been far more scattered and irregular than planners had anticipated, it is anticipated that the direct role of state action will be less significant than intended, but the role of state-sanctioned property rights may still be found to be important in creating a framework within which individuals and groups can operate independently with greater confidence.  This project will provide valuable new insights and information about the contemporary spatial dynamics of Vietnam, a nation that receives relatively little scholarly attention.  The project will contribute empirical evidence to ongoing debates in the scholarly literature regarding the impacts of property rights and land titles on land development in developing nations, and it will shed new insights about the motivations and actions of private entrepreneurs in transitional societies.

Close to 90% of children in immigrant families perform a language brokering function in their family's resettlement process, taking on the task of translating between the heritage language and English for parents with limited English-speaking skills.  However, scholars have thus far paid little attention to the developmental consequences of being a language broker.  This project on Mexican American families will explore the language brokering experience from multiple perspectives (target child, mother, father).  The goal is to illuminate how language brokering impacts parent-child relationships and, more importantly, how it affects children's adjustment in terms of both academic and socio-emotional outcomes.  Three hundred fifty Mexican American families will be recruited for the project, from schools with a wide range of Latinos in the student population. The study has three research aims: 1) to understand how child language brokering affects parent-child relationships, including any differential effects for mothers and fathers; 2) to investigate how parent-child relationships may be linked to child adjustment in terms of both socio-emotional development and academic outcomes; and 3) to explore how adolescent gender and schools'/neighborhoods' density of Mexican immigrants may influence aims 1 and 2.  This project has the potential to bring to light the effects language brokering may have on the adjustment of the children of Mexican immigrants, the largest and fastest growing minority group in the United States.<br/><br/><br/>This study will examine developmental outcomes for children of Mexican immigrants, a high-risk population with high rates of poverty and low levels of educational attainment. The project aims to understand the mechanisms involved in improving the academic performance of children of immigrants, a growing and significant percentage of America's children, who represent the future of the U.S. workforce.  It also focuses on the developmental period of adolescence, a period of transition in which children are susceptible to developing socio-emotional problems that can compromise school performance.  This research has the potential to identify risk factors that can be used to inform future preventive intervention work with children of immigrants.  Finally, this project will train undergraduate and graduate students who have been traditionally under-represented in the sciences, particularly those of Mexican origin; deliver a curriculum to educate students about the role of immigration, ethnicity, and race in informing child development; and provide workshops, training sessions, and newsletters to educators on the role of language brokering in children's academic functioning.", "This award supports theoretical research directed at advancing our understanding of both the interplay between interaction and disorder effects, and out-of-equilibrium phenomena in condensed matter systems.  The research will investigate the combined effects of interaction and disorder in two-dimensional electronic systems, and the consequences of this combination on spin polarization effects in Si-MOSFET's; the possible metallic and glassy phases in thin films where a superconductor-insulator transition is observed; and thermal transport of interacting quasiparticles inside gapless superconductors.  The work will address non-equilibrium phenomena, such as spatial heterogeneities and mesoscopic fluctuations in the aging dynamics of glassy systems, and slow relaxation in electronic glasses, such as that recently observed in CdSe artificial solids.  Finally, the research will address non-equilibrium transport, detection, and dissipation of spin currents through quantum wires and dots.  <br/><br/>This award will have a broad impact.  While studying phenomena in specific material systems, new theoretical and computational methods will be developed for addressing fundamental problems of out-of-equilibrium phenomena and of combined interaction and disorder effects in condensed matter systems.

Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 29440, "graph":

frameworks have emerged from the work of researchers examining the complex political, economic, and cultural dynamics through which individuals and groups engage in agricultural production.  Among the theories that have shed new light on certain facets of this problem are political ecology, non-market struggles in agricultural production, and contract farming.  This doctoral dissertation research project will examine how the land-management practices, land-use controls, and land access of clove farmers in north central Indonesia change in response to their use of different strategies for obtaining credit.  The project will be conducted in Tincep village in the province of Minahasa on the northern part of the island of Sulawesi.  A range of qualitative research approaches, including participant observation, survey, and in-depth, semi-structured interviews as well as analyses of government documents and traders' record books, will be used to assess which economic, political, and social strategies farmers in conjunction with specific crediting strategies.  Special attention will be given to analyses of the roles that different kinds of creditors, including some technically outlawed under contracts between farmers and the state.  Among the broader questions to be addressed through this project are:  Why have clove farmers chosen to engage in particular crediting arrangements with village-based crop mortgagers or city-based speculators at specific times in the harvest cycle and over specific periods during the last decade?  How do struggles over land-management practices reflect struggles over who has legitimate standing to take part in different kinds of capital accumulation?  What is the impact of different types of crediting systems on land-management and production practices?  This project will shed new light on the highly variable roles and relationships of different groups in the clove-based agricultural economy of the region.  It will examine how state policies have fostered the development of particular kinds of crediting practices, and it will challenge more standard notions of what it means to be a farmer, a creditor, or a local official and how this shapes what kinds of credit-related relationships arise in this production system.

The project asks how the choice of institutions for linking practitioners and experts influences knowledge production and its outcomes in the context of a central challenge of sustainability: improving the management of natural resources. The project seeks to apply, evaluate and extend existing scholarly findings on \"boundary organizations\" as institutional means for facilitating the collaboration among researchers and users in the production of knowledge for natural resource management in the developing world.  The scholarship on \"boundary organizations\" examines the dynamics and consequences of alternative institutional arrangements for facilitating collaboration among researchers, users, and intermediary bodies in the integration of knowledge and policy.  Little attention has been given to the complex networks of experts, practitioners and intermediaries that characterize science-based policy for international development. Less has been given to power asymmetries among stakeholders that characterize most sustainable development problems in the developing world. The scholarly questions addressed by this project are: To what extent does the existing boundary organization framework illuminate the role of institutions in the multi-party, power-embedded negotiations characteristic of efforts to implement science-based sustainability strategies in international development? How can the existing boundary organization framework be generalized to cover this important class of expert-practitioner collaborations in knowledge production?  This project explores the role of boundary organizations in the context of one of the principal science-intensive challenges facing sustainable development.  It focuses on policy innovations for improving natural resource: \"payments for environmental services\" (PES) designed to simultaneously mitigate poverty and enhance conservation. PES approaches require broad political support to have a chance of success, but also require knowledge of the nature and value of services actually provided by alternative resource use decisions, of the opportunity costs to resource users of decisions that provide services to others, and of actual resource use patterns. To mobilize or create such shared knowledge often requires collaborations among researchers, policy practitioners, resource users and intermediaries operating at scales from the global to local. The practical question the project addresses is: What kind of boundary organizations can best promote the shared knowledge production needed for effective and equitable policies for natural resource management, in particular for science-intensive policies such as those involving payments for environmental services?  The project approaches these questions through the comparative analysis of initiatives now underway in Asia to create mechanisms that reward the upland poor for the environmental services they provide (RUPES). RUPES mobilizes scientific research and local knowledge at 15 sites across SE Asia to characterize the impacts of land use practices on local livelihoods and on environmental services at multiple scales. The project analyzes covariation in the structure and outcomes of boundary organizations employed by RUPES sites for natural resource management (NRM).  The project will generalize existing \"western\" concepts of boundary organizations to encompass the broader range of extended, multi-scale, asymmetrically empowered collaborations typical of efforts to harness science and technology to support international development.  It would also broaden perspectives of ongoing programs of research on \"Mode-2\" knowledge production.   The project will enhance RUPES' ongoing assessment - sharpening the lessons it learns regarding boundary organizations; increase the capacity of professionals working on science-based NRM strategies to bring together experts and practitioners; and build key human capital. More broadly, it will promote the integration of knowledge and policy for natural resource management.", "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project supported by Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program seeks to develop the rational design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) nanowire materials whose growth is driven by screw dislocations and to investigate their fundamental characteristics. Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 36184, "graph":

initiatives to increase substantially the quantity and quality of minority and other students receiving baccalaureate degrees in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET).  The proposed USM LSAMP, Phase II will continue and expand activities begun in Phase I.  It also is expected to increase the number of minority and other SMET students earning doctoral degrees and entering SMET careers, especially faculty positions.  The following SM institutions to participate as full partners in the proposed USM LSAMP, Phase II:  1) The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), 2) University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP); and 3) The University of Maryland, Eastern Shore (UMES), a historically black institution. Dr. Freeman Hrabowski, III, President of UMBC, will continue as the principal investigator of the proposed USM LSAMP, Phase II.  He has received national recognition for his leadership in developing innovative programs to expand education opportunities for minority SMET students.  Dr. Hrabowski received the National Science Foundation's 1994 Education Achievement Award for his outstanding commitment and dedication in the education for minorities in the fields of science and mathematics, and his latest book, Beating the Odds, focuses on the fundamentals that help Black males achieve academic excellence.<br/><br/>Also participating in the proposed USM LSAMP, Phase II will be the 18 public community colleges in Maryland.  The following community colleges are located in close proximity to the participating USM institutions and serve as the primary feeders of minority and other SMET transfer students:  1) Anne Arundel Community College; 2) Baltimore City Community College; 3) Community College of Baltimore County at Catonsville; 4)Chesapeake Community College; 5)Howard Community College; 6) Montgomery Community College; 7) Prince Georges Community College; and 8)Wor Wic Community College.  During Phase II, efforts to increase the number of minority and other SMET students transferring to USM LSAMP universities from the remaining 10 community colleges will be expanded.<br/><br/>In support of NSF's goal, the primary goal of the proposed USM LSAMP, Phase II is the following.<br/><br/>To produce approximately 574 minority SMET baccalaureate recipients by the end of the 2000-2001 academic year; approximately 648 minority SMET baccalaureate recipients by the end of the 2001-2002 school year; approximately 722 minority SMET baccalaureate recipients by the end of the 2002-2003 academic year; approximately 796 minority SMET baccalaureate recipients by the end of the 2003-2004 academic year; and approximately 887 minority SMET baccalaureate recipients by the end of the 2004-2005 academic year<br/><br/>The secondary goals of the proposed USM LSAMP II are the following.<br/><br/>To increase the number of minority students entering SMET graduate programs.<br/>To increase the number of minority students entering SMET careers, especially faculty positions.<br/><br/>Based in evaluations of current and previous programs aimed at increasing minority participation in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology at the participating USM universities, the proposed USM LSAMP, Phase II's design includes the following characteristics:.<br/><br/>Strong commitment by institutional leaders to the program's success and to its complete institutionalization beginning on January 6, 2006;<br/>Removal of financial barriers for minority students;<br/>A Summer Bridge Component;<br/>An Academic Year Component;<br/>Focus on improving knowledge and skills;<br/>Focus on motivation and support;<br/>Focus on monitoring and advising;<br/>Focus on academic and social interaction;<br/>Focus on \"filter\" SMET course curricula revision; and<br/>Involvement of feeder community colleges.<br/>", "similar_id": [58144, 21508, 21398], "weight": [0.272337406873703, 0.33380717039108276, 0.393855482339859], "similar_title": ["RET Site: Science and Mechatronics Aided Research for Teachers with an Entrepreneurship expeRience (SMARTER)", "CAREER: Liberative Pedagogies in Engineering Education", "CAREER: Microbial Geochemistry of Natural Marine Gas Seeps - A Research and Education Plan"], "similar_abstract": ["This award provides funding for a three year continuing award for a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site Program at Polytechnic University of New York, entitled, RET Site: Science and Mechatronics Aided Research for Teachers with an Entrepreneurship expeRience (SMARTER) Program, under the direction of Dr. Vikram Kapila. This is a renewal of a successful 3 year RET Site program. <br/><br/>The SMARTER program will provide a professional development opportunity to a total of 36 middle and high school in-service teachers (12 per year for three years) in the areas of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and entrepreneurship from the New York City Public Schools.  During each year of the project, under the guidance of Dr. Kapila and six senior personnel, 12 teachers will receive mentoring and conduct inquiry-based, hands-on, engineering research in the exciting field of mechatronics through six-week long summer workshops.  Collaborative activities involving Technology Management faculty and the Centers for Entrepreneurship and Technology will enable teachers to learn about entrepreneurship, conduct innovation case-studies, and shadow entrepreneurs.  <br/><br/>The project will benefit the teachers by reinforcing their science and math skills; enriching their STEM experience through exposure to real-world engineering research; developing and honing their research skills; cultivating and sustaining creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship traits; and providing opportunities to network with tech-entrepreneurs.  Moreover, the teachers' schools will benefit since the participants will be able to provide their students with a solid foundation for college-level study in STEM; integrate hands-on activities with content and performance standards in curriculum; and mentor students to participate in an Inno/Vention student idea competition.  A business-philanthropy partnership will allow teachers' students to gain real-world entrepreneurial experience through summer internships at start-up technology businesses.  The project will serve as a catalyst to induce a cultural change that will transform students from being mere consumers of technology to becoming creators of novel technological products.", "Intellectual Merit: Many educators in the humanities and social sciences employ pedagogies based to engage students in creating a democratic classroom that encourages all voices.  The goal of this CAREER award is to bring these pedagogies to engineering education and encourage their widespread use in curriculum development as a means to improve the discipline's capacity to successfully attract, retain, educate and advance the broadest possible spectrum of students.  <br/><br/>Previous work on cognitive approaches to engineering education and on increasing diversity in the engineering profession affirm techniques proposed by liberative pedagogies, which have a three-decade track record of successful implementation in the social sciences and humanities.  These philosophies should be applied, tested, and enhanced in a constructive feedback loop in engineering education because they represent good educational practice, because they may advance the engagement of underrepresented groups in engineering, and because they challenge educators to rethink the purposes and goals of engineering education itself.   <br/><br/>The goals of this Liberative Pedagogies project include: (1) Develop and implement curricular innovations based on liberative pedagogies and student input; (2) Evaluate curricular and pedagogical changes based on liberative pedagogies using both conventional and liberative assessment tools; (3) to understand how women students conceptualize their identities as engineering students and/or future engineers; (4) Disseminate results on campus, in local preK-12 education, and throughout the engineering education community; and (5) Involve students in curricular development based on liberative pedagogies. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The findings will assist engineering educators nationwide in the shift toward learner-centered education by providing important data about student beliefs and attitudes toward <br/>liberative pedagogies in engineering, as well as assessing their implementation in first-year, core, and upper-level elective courses including Engineering Thermodynamics, Mass and Energy Balances, Heat and Mass Transfer, and Engineering and Global Development.  The project will develop and test assessment tools and methods based on these pedagogical approaches that will be of service to faculty seeking to adapt their classrooms and curricula to diverse learners.<br/>", "ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Valentine / OCE-0447395<br/><br/>In this CAREER project, a researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara will conduct an integrated research and education program focusing on the fate of methane seeping naturally into the marine environment, an issue of environmental and economic relevance.  The primary research goal is to determine the impact of microbial methane oxidation on the flux of methane from the sediments to the ocean/atmosphere in areas of active gas seepage.    The research will involve a combination of field and laboratory studies of three gas seep environments located offshore the UCSB campus, at depths ranging from 10m to 300m.   The primary research goal will be achieved by quantifying both the net gas flux emanating from the sediment as well as the net rate of microbial methane oxidation within the sediment, and comparing the relative importance of each process across the three study sites.  This proposal further seeks to integrate the proposed research with educational activities at the graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 levels.<br/><br/>The educational goals of the proposed project are:  (1) to train graduate (Ph.D.  & M.S.) students in the integrated study of microbiology and geochemistry; (2) to educate undergraduate students in the marine sciences through year-long research projects, and through incorporation of results into general education courses; (3) to incorporate undergraduate students into ocean going research by including them as active participants in proposed cruises through a formal field studies course; and (4) to introduce K-12 students and teachers to the topic of marine hydrocarbons through participation in UCSB's Floating Lab outreach program.  These educational goals of this project will be achieved by incorporating graduate and undergraduate students into every stage of the research project, by incorporating results into general education courses, and through outreach activities that will bring approximately one thousand K-12 students to local seep fields annually.  The massive gas seeps offshore UCSB provide an ideal natural laboratory for a CAREER project.  Seeps are readily accessible from the campus, they engender curiosity in students, they have a tangible environmental impact, and the underlying microbial processes are important yet poorly understood.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project promises to contribute fundamental knowledge to the global biogeochemical cycle of methane, to provide interdisciplinary training for graduate students in chemical and biological aspects of ocean science, to provide educational opportunities for undergraduate students in the area of marine science, and to educate K-12 students and teachers through outreach activities.   Furthermore, this research has the potential to reveal a variety of novel microbes and microbial activities, has potential applications in the field of bioremediation, and may lead to the discovery of new gas seep environments offshore California.   <br/>"], "person": 18769, "graph": {"paper_cite_paper": [[7, 19, 21, 22, 34, 34, 35, 37, 61, 63, 65, 72, 82, 82, 84, 88, 88, 91, 96, 96, 111, 118, 129,

Furthermore, this work will transform neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life for a large number of neurological patients. The central question that motivates this proposal is: Does the brain use motor programs to help it control a highly redundant multi-degree of freedom (DOF) biomechanical plant such as the arm? To answer this question, this project will conduct a series of experiments that require a combination of three major innovations at the experimental (BMI), theoretical (hybrid control), and technical (exoskeleton design) level. This proposal aims to synthesize all three innovations into a new experimental paradigm unifying brain, biomechanics, and behavior. Specifically, visually-cued motor plans in the motor cortices of macaque monkeys will be: 1) read by a BMI, 2) interpreted by a hybrid controller and a musculoskeletal model, and 3) translated into appropriate movements and stiffness in a multi-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>At a societal level, this proposal seeks to create a significant advancement in neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from paralysis due to lesions of the central nervous system or other neurological disorders. BMIs will make a great impact in the quality of life for neurological patients by providing reliable performance when interacting with real objects and in real-world scenarios. This proposal also informs motor systems neuroscience by proposing a novel framework to study how neural ensembles can learn to control a multi-DOF exoskeleton by volitional modulation of neural activity in real-world tasks. It provides a critical link between neural events and real-world dynamics through a novel hierarchical distributed control scheme for hybrid systems identification and control that captures the continuous time evolution of the arm/exoskeleton, as well as the dynamically changing sequence of tasks. No motor task of this complexity has ever been demonstrated in a BMI system. The potential impact of the proposed work is immense. If successful, this work will transform our understanding about how the brain controls movement, and will introduce a paradigm shift in the development of the next generation of neural prosthetics that will restore motor function in millions of neurologically impaired patients ? a development which may very well impact other domains such as human-machine interaction and innovative user interfaces. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The dissemination of data and research findings from this project will be done through a project website. Our codes will be open source, and the methods, algorithms and results will be available through publications in the fields of neuroscience, control and robotics. Through the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at Berkeley, research results from this program will be immediately accessible and distributed to a large engineering community, in particular other interdisciplinary research groups. Also, the findings in the proposed research will be outreached to K-12 students and their parents through various activities at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS), such as CAL-day. In addition, research findings will be disseminated through workshops at the main annual conferences in neuroscience, robotics, control, and biomedical engineering. The educational component of this proposal relies on BMI as a platform for interdisciplinary education in science and engineering. New graduate-level courses will be introduced and existing courses will be enhanced based on results of this project. The proposed efforts will open doors to student rotations between neuroscientists, control theorists and roboticists. In addition to postdocs and graduate students, undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the project: modeling, analysis, simulation, prototype development and experimentation. Special effort will be placed on the recruitment of individuals from underrepresented groups including women, thereby building on the strong record the PIs have in this area.", "Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference<br/><br/>This conference brings together researchers academia and industry focused on research topics related to the Graphics and Visualization subarea of the CPA cluster.

Politics in the New West", "abstract": "The complex political processes associated with environmental politics in the U.S. involve local residents, including property owners, businesses, and residents; governmental bodies ranging from local through state to federal agencies; and non-governmental organizations, some of which are locally based, but many of which have regional or national constituencies.  Scholarly attention has focused on all three general groups, although more attention has focused on local-and national-scale interactions than on political activities at the regional scale.  This doctoral dissertation research project will contribute to a better understanding of contemporary environmental politics through a case study examining the goals, strategies, and representational practices of one particular environmental organization.  The Greater Yellowstone Coalition, based in Bozeman, Montana, attempts to influence public policy in a region experiencing rapid growth and characterized by divergent interest groups -- urban and rural populations, long-time residents and new migrants, ranchers and environmentalists.  The study will situate the coalition within this regional politics and will proceed to a detailed analysis of the coalition's activities over the last five years.  Attention will focus on three interrelated dimensions:  (1) the goals of the coalition, how those goals are defined, and how well they represent the views of coalition members; (2) the specific strategies (legal, legislative, and scientific) that the coalition has used in attempting to achieve these goals as well as the varying spatial scales at which those strategies have been deployed; and (3) representations (especially of Yellowstone National Park, the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, and Montana as \"the last best place\") that the coalition has used in pursuing those strategies.  The study will include a survey of 1,500 coalition members (approximately 20% of total membership), extensive interviews with coalition leaders and staff, and careful analysis of the materials produced by the coalition in the last five years, including newsletters, advertisements, reports, and legal documents.  This project will enhance understanding of the mechanisms of environmental politics and the ways in which environmental policy is shaped from the grassroots level.  More broadly, it will contribute to research on regional change in the age of globalization.  The rapid transformation of the ways of life and land uses in the greater Yellowstone region affects the goals and policies of the coalition, while the coalition's activities help shape the direction and pace of change.  The coalition therefore represents regional organizations that have become active players in reshaping the landscape of the West, and analysis of its operations and actions provides one lens through which the mechanisms and processes of regional change can be better understood.

Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers.", "This award provides funding for a three year continuing award for a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site Program at Polytechnic University of New York, entitled, RET Site: Science and Mechatronics Aided Research for Teachers with an Entrepreneurship expeRience (SMARTER) Program, under the direction of Dr. Vikram Kapila. This is a renewal of a successful 3 year RET Site program. <br/><br/>The SMARTER program will provide a professional development opportunity to a total of 36 middle and high school in-service teachers (12 per year for three years) in the areas of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and entrepreneurship from the New York City Public Schools.  During each year of the project, under the guidance of Dr. Kapila and six senior personnel, 12 teachers will receive mentoring and conduct inquiry-based, hands-on, engineering research in the exciting field of mechatronics through six-week long summer workshops.  Collaborative activities involving Technology Management faculty and the Centers for Entrepreneurship and Technology will enable teachers to learn about entrepreneurship, conduct innovation case-studies, and shadow entrepreneurs.  <br/><br/>The project will benefit the teachers by reinforcing their science and math skills; enriching their STEM experience through exposure to real-world engineering research; developing and honing their research skills; cultivating and sustaining creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship traits; and providing opportunities to network with tech-entrepreneurs.  Moreover, the teachers' schools will benefit since the participants will be able to provide their students with a solid foundation for college-level study in STEM; integrate hands-on activities with content and performance standards in curriculum; and mentor students to participate in an Inno/Vention student idea competition.  A business-philanthropy partnership will allow teachers' students to gain real-world entrepreneurial experience through summer internships at start-up technology businesses.  The project will serve as a catalyst to induce a cultural change that will transform students from being mere consumers of technology to becoming creators of novel technological products.", "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"<br/><br/>0845934<br/>D. Ramirez<br/><br/>Engineered nanomaterials have unique chemical and physical properties that make them desirable for widespread applications including environmental remediation, energy conversion, catalyst support and biomedical use. Despite their benefits, questions need to be answered about the impacts of such nanomaterials on human health, safety and the environment. Principal objectives of the proposed research are to investigate the transformations of engineered nanomaterials as they interact with hazardous air pollutants in the environment and to determine the efficiency of air pollution control devices to adsorb and desorb pollutants associated with engineered nanomaterials. Systematic research methods and innovative mathematical models based on quantitative-structure activity relationships will be developed to characterize the adsorption and desorption of hazardous air pollutants on engineered nanomaterials. This research project consists of the following main tasks: (1) to characterize the adsorption of hazardous air pollutants on engineered nanomaterials including C60 fullerenes, single- and multi- wall carbon nanotubes, and silica; (2) to examine the effect of humidity and nanomaterial morphology on the atmospheric adsorption and desorption of air pollutants on nanomaterials; (3) to model single- and multi-component sorption based on quantitative-structure activity relationships; and (4) examine the effect of concentration of pollutant associated nanomaterials on their removal efficiency using filtration and adsorption systems. The proposed research plan will be one of the first efforts to evaluate the efficiency of filtration and activated carbon adsorption systems, typically used in industry, for removing specific engineered nanomaterials in the gas phase. The research described in this proposal is novel and potentially transformative in that, if successful, it would lead to new technology for the evaluation of the impacts of hazardous air pollutant-associated engineered nanomaterials on human health, safety and the environment.<br/><br/>As a new Hispanic faculty member in the Environmental Engineering Department at Texas A&M University

The project will investigate four categories of issues-Implementation Process, TPD Benefits and Outcomes, Community Building, and Technology Use and Satisfaction-using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.  SECTION A - PROJECT SUMMARY<br/><br/>Research on educational applications of Internet technology and research on teacher professional development (TPD) each can substantially benefit from the experience and expertise of the other.  TPD programs need mechanisms for extending their reach that computer networks can provide.  Education technology research suggests that virtual communities for TPD and socialization can help teachers learn new skills and adopt new approaches that will facilitate their transition to reform-based classroom practices.  The common ground on which the two disciplines can come together is the opportunity to jointly develop effective, scalable on-line TPD models based on the social computing affordances of a new generation of Internet technologies.<br/><br/>Many K-12 research and teacher enhancement projects are exploring the intersection of TPD and technology by providing email, listservs, and Websites to distributed groups of teachers in the context of some pedagogical intervention.  However, we believe that most current offerings only peripherally reflect established notions of successful working communities.  They provide few of the tools, communication channels, and contextual supports needed to sustain the kinds of cognitive, collaborative, and social interactions that are characteristic of successful collaborative work or communities of practice, and therefore provide limited insights into how to achieve sustainable and scalable on-line TPD communities.  <br/><br/>Education technology researchers need to better understand the practices and social structures of teacher professional development communities in order to develop appropriate communication channels and collaborative tools to support those practices and structures.  For example, real-time collaboration and social interaction are central characteristics of successful professional development that serve as key mechanisms for facilitating learning of new teaching strategies and promoting success in adapting to new practices.  However, with the exception of the occasional satellite video link-up, chat, or CUSeeMe session, on-line teacher support projects have not begun to tap (much less systematically investigate) the potential benefits of real-time collaboration through the Internet, leaving an incomplete research foundation on which to base the development of on-line TPD communities.  As a consequence, efforts by school districts, TPD providers, and state and regional projects to establish and sustain on-line TPD communities too often result in a disappointing mismatch between capabilities that are expedient to implement and the expressed needs and requirements of TPD activities.  <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed 3-year project is to establish an on-line TPD research testbed to (a) <br/>The research will help SME&T education reform researchers and practitioners better understand and implement next-generation Internet technologies and help inform local and state policy-makers of the cost efficiencies and benefits of investing in on-line professional development.  Participation in such communities will accelerate teacher adoption of SME&T education reform efforts by providing wider and more equitable access to high-quality TPD opportunities.  Our findings will also help NSF achieve its goal of infusing urban, rural, and state systemic initiatives with the fruits of NSF research on content and pedagogy by providing a familiar and supportive venue for introducing new ideas and technologies into a context of ongoing TPD activity.<br/>", "similar_id": [65691, 58144, 55992], "weight": [0.16090308129787445, 0.30399227142333984, 0.5351046919822693], "similar_title": ["REU Site: NEESreu- Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation: Reducing Seismic Vulnerability", "RET Site: Science and Mechatronics Aided Research for Teachers with an Entrepreneurship expeRience (SMARTER)", "Fundamental Investigation and Development of Screw Dislocation-Driven Nanowire Growth"], "similar_abstract": ["The George E.

This is a renewal of a successful 3 year RET Site program. <br/><br/>The SMARTER program will provide a professional development opportunity to a total of 36 middle and high school in-service teachers (12 per year for three years) in the areas of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and entrepreneurship from the New York City Public Schools.  During each year of the project, under the guidance of Dr. Kapila and six senior personnel, 12 teachers will receive mentoring and conduct inquiry-based, hands-on, engineering research in the exciting field of mechatronics through six-week long summer workshops.  Collaborative activities involving Technology Management faculty and the Centers for Entrepreneurship and Technology will enable teachers to learn about entrepreneurship, conduct innovation case-studies, and shadow entrepreneurs.  <br/><br/>The project will benefit the teachers by reinforcing their science and math skills; enriching their STEM experience through exposure to real-world engineering research; developing and honing their research skills; cultivating and sustaining creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship traits; and providing opportunities to network with tech-entrepreneurs.  Moreover, the teachers' schools will benefit since the participants will be able to provide their students with a solid foundation for college-level study in STEM; integrate hands-on activities with content and performance standards in curriculum; and mentor students to participate in an Inno/Vention student idea competition.  A business-philanthropy partnership will allow teachers' students to gain real-world entrepreneurial experience through summer internships at start-up technology businesses.

Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers."], "person": 38205, "graph":

Experiment (SOFeX): Mesoscale Iron Fertilization Effects on Plankton Community Structure, Growth and Zooplankton Grazing", "abstract": "The Southern Ocean is a critical region for understanding the role of the oceans in global carbon cycling and its potential to regulate climate change. Besides being an area of high influx of atmospheric carbon and deep water formation, the persistently high concentrations of major nutrients in Antarctic circumpolar waters represent the largest pool of unrealized primary production potential in the oceans. This project is part of a larger effort to test the hypothesis that iron availability limits phytoplankton production and biomass accumulation, nutrient utilization and C02drawdown in the Southern Ocean.   Drs. Landry, Chisholm and Bidigare, will contribute by investigating the effects of iron enrichment and silicate availability on the species composition and size structure of the plankton community and taxon-specific growth rates and fluorescence responses of the phytoplankton. Functional and taxonomic components of the plankton community from bacteria to mesozooplankton will be quantified by a combination of flow cytometry, taxon-specific pigments, video image-analysis microscopy and optical plankton counting. In addition, they will use dilution and gut fluorescence techniques to determine micro- and mesozooplankton contributions to grazing and to evaluate grazing as an alternate control mechanism preventing significant net growth of some or all of the phytoplankton populations. The research will bring a community perspective to the interpretation of these in situ fertilization experiments which is essential for a mechanistic understanding of the biological and geochemical responses.", "similar_id": [55992, 37749, 53751], "weight": [0.07638828456401825, 0.1898578405380249, 0.7337539196014404], "similar_title": ["Fundamental Investigation and Development of Screw Dislocation-Driven Nanowire Growth", "Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference", "Collaborative Research:  Type 1: LOI: L02170303: Arctic Climate Response to Decadal Changes in Radiative Forcing from Aerosols and Ozone"], "similar_abstract": ["TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>This project supported by Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program seeks to develop the rational design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) nanowire materials whose growth is driven by screw dislocations and to investigate their fundamental characteristics. Nanowires and other 1D nanomaterials possess interesting properties that have already found many applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a nanowire growth mechanism completely different from the traditional metal-catalyzed nanowire growth, in which axial screw dislocations drive the anisotropic 1D crystal growth and enable the formation of 1D nanostructures. Bridging classical crystal growth theories with modern nanomaterial synthesis, this project focuses on the fundamental investigation and development of screw dislocation-driven nanowire growth to extend its generality among diverse materials, demonstrate the versatility in creating more complex nanostructures, scale up the solution catalyst-free growth of nanowires, and understand the physical properties of dislocation-driven nanowires. This understanding will create a new dimension in the rational design and synthesis of 1D nanomaterials and enable exploitation of a catalyst-free growth mechanism for large scale/low cost solution growth of 1D nanomaterials for diverse applications. <br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Nanowires and other one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have significant applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, solar energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and energy storage. Professor Song Jin and his students had discovered a different way of synthesizing nanowire materials that are driven by screw dislocation defects. This new mechanism of nanowire growth will be studied and further developed so that its significant advantages can be rationally exploited to open up a new dimension in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials, especially for large scale and low cost solution growth. The proposed research can potentially have transformative impacts on the rational synthesis of 1D nanomaterials that will enable a variety of large scale applications of these materials, such as in renewable energy. Furthermore, education and outreach will be integrated with active research in this project by recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students to participate in nanomaterial research, by developing new modules for a web course on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and by further developing a nanoscience workshop for high school students and teachers.", "Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference<br/><br/>This conference brings together researchers academia and industry focused on research topics related to the Graphics and Visualization subarea of the CPA cluster. A five-member student panel will be supported that allows students to take a more active and integral role in voicing new research directions of interest to the research community. Among the topics to be discussed on the student panel are defining the future of virtual reality research, identifying killer virtual reality applications, and building careers in this research area. This outreach activity helps to broaden the participation of students in this research field.", "Current general circulation models (GCMs) have difficulty reproducing the rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss observed over the past decades. One possible factor is that they do not properly represent the radiative forcings from aerosols and tropospheric ozone that could be particularly important in the Arctic. This EaSM Type 1 project will develop an improved understanding of the distributions and decadal trends of aerosols and ozone in the Arctic, including black carbon (BC) deposition fluxes and albedo effects for snow and sea ice, and will study the implications for Arctic climate change over the 1980-2010 period. It will build an interdisciplinary partnership between atmospheric chemists using the GEOS-Chem CTM and cryosphere scientists using CCSM4, to better describe aerosol-chemistry-climate interactions in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The project will take advantage of intensive observations during the International Polar Year (IPY) to test and improve the GEOS-Chem representation of aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes in the Arctic. A 30-year GEOS-Chem simulation (1980-2010) with evolving sources from human activity and fires will be conducted and evaluated against long-term records. Aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes from GEOS-Chem will be input to CCSM4 to simulate Arctic radiative forcing and climate response over the 30-year period. Ensemble sensitivity simulations conducted with CCSM4 will diagnose the perturbations to temperature, sea ice, and atmospheric circulation associated with these radiative forcings. Knowledge gained from this project will be used to evaluate the simulation of Arctic aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and BC deposition fluxes within CESM. Fully coupled aerosol-chemistry-climate simulations of the 1980-2010 period will be conducted in CESM to assess Arctic climate response from aerosols and ozone and to investigate climate feedbacks.  This project will also provide policy analysts with information on the role of aerosols and tropospheric ozone in driving Arctic climate change.

Sensu Lato", "abstract": "Members of the Montastraea annularis complex are the major reef building corals in the Caribbean, and they have been a model system for studies of the ecology and geology of coral reefs. Three taxa have been described (M annularis, M ftanksi and M faveolata), although their status as separate species has been questioned. Since the 1980's, these corals, along with several others, have declined drastically in abundance at many sites. In order for M annularis to persist and recover, it must reproduce. However, almost nothing is known about the reproductive success of this or any Caribbean coral.  The major focus of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the spawning behavior, gamete compatibilities and fertilization rates of the three members of the M annularis complex. Data collected previously from Panama suggest that differences in spawning times and gametic compatibility are sufficient to maintain reproductive boundaries among the three taxa. These barriers have the additional consequence of increasing the distance between potential mates on many reefs. Fertilization rates in the field appear to be quite low, most likely because of the distances between spawning conspecifics. Selfed crosses are generally unsuccessful.  Preliminary work has established research protocols for collecting these types of data, but the bulk of the data collection over a range of spawning conditions lies ahead. We propose to accomplish this through a five-year program in Panama. Laboratory experiments will determine how gamete longevity and gamete concentration influence fertilization success. This provides important information for determining the consequences of asynchronous spawning. Field studies will document the spawning times of each taxon and the fertilization rates and gamete concentrations in the water column during spawning events. Drogues that simulate gamete dispersal will be used to determine the patterns of dispersal under a variety of conditions in order to get a more robust understanding of how gametes can be advected from the reef. This work will provide the first information on in situ rates of fertilization success and the mechanisms that influence fertilization rates for any Caribbean hard coral. The importance of this species to coral reef communities and the recent declines in this coral make the proposed study all the more timely.", "similar_id": [72818, 66535, 37749], "weight": [0.2489466518163681, 0.3258390724658966, 0.4252142906188965], "similar_title": ["Collaborative Research:   Proterozoic Mountain Building and Collapse, Eastern Adirondacks, New York", "Computer Modeling of Proton Conduction in Metal-Organic Frameworks", "Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference"], "similar_abstract": ["Rocks of the Adirondack Mountains of New York represent a large dome-shaped uplift of the Precambrian basement of North America. These rocks record the assembly and breakup of the supercontinent, \"Rodinia\" that formed approximately 1 billion years ago. The formation and dispersal of this continent may have played a role in the evolution of life on Earth, the evolution of climate and the production of a snowball Earth, and in the development of important economic resources, including Rare Earth Element deposits. New data are significantly changing our understanding of the history of the Adirondack uplift. A major period of mountain-building, the 1180 million year Shawinigan orogeny, was previously unrecognized in the region, and one challenge involves recognizing and distinguishing the effects of this tectonism compared to the 1050 Million year Ottawan orogeny that was previously thought to dominate the geology of this region. The latest stages in the geologic history of the Adirondacks involved intrusion of extensive granite (\"Lyon Mountain granite\") and the development of shear zones that were important in the collapse of the mountains and in the uplift of the basement rocks. This research will involve modern structural, petrologic, and geochronologic analysis to characterize the geologic and tectonic history of the eastern Adirondack region, and further our understanding of mid crustal processes during mountain building and collapse. This work represents a new collaboration between the University of Massachusetts and Castleton State College, a predominantly undergraduate state college nearly adjacent to the Adirondack field area. In addition to the PIs, the research team will consist of undergraduates from Castleton State College and a graduate student from the University of Massachusetts. The graduate student will serve as a mentor for undergraduates from Castleton and a link between the two institutions.

Finally, the eastern Adirondack Mountains are a popular destination for hiking, camping, and vacations. Student researchers will work to develop outreach materials and programs about the geology of the spectacular northeastern Adirondack region.<br/><br/>This research tests the hypothesis that there is a regionally extensive shear zone in the eastern Adirondacks in the vicinity of Whitehall, New York that accommodated the eastward unroofing of the Adirondack Mountains during orogenic collapse shortly after the culmination of the Ottawan orogenic event (ca. 1050 Ma).  Preliminary in-situ monazite ages constrain the extensional shearing to 1050-1026 Ma, similar to those reported for the extensional movement on the Carthage-Colton shear zone in the NW Adirondacks. These data suggest that orogenic collapse following the Ottawan orogeny resulted in the formation of a two-sided metamorphic core complex or gneiss dome structure. This project will utilize in-situ high resolution monazite geochronology, in conjunction with detailed field mapping, structural and kinematic analysis, and metamorphic petrology in order to characterize the extent, kinematics, and timing of East Adirondack shearing and to integrate the shear zone into the overall tectonic history of the Adirondack Mountains. The Grenville orogen marks the culminating collision in the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. Post-collisional collapse of the Himalayan-scale Grenville orogen signaled the start of a new phase of rifting, passive margin development, and in the broadest sense, the Appalachian Wilson cycle. Major changes have been proposed in the character and age of tectonic events involved in the construction and collapse of the orogen. With the coming of Earthscope-US-Array and GeoPrisms it is critical to evaluate new models for this orogen that may have had a controlling influence on the geometry and character of the proto-Atlantic margin. The proposed research will involve detailed field mapping and structural/petrographic analysis in order to establish a chronologic framework for the development and overprinting relationships of fabrics and metamorphic mineral assemblages. Rocks related to each of the major stages of Adirondack orogenesis (Elsevirian, Shawinigan, AMCG plutonism, Ottawan, etc) are all in close proximity in the eastern Adirondacks. The project involves the use of thermobarometry and psuedosection analysis to delineate the Pressure-Temperature evolution of the crust during the orogenic events with particular focus on the late-stage shearing. A major portion of the work will involve in-situ monazite geochronology in order to place timing constraints on all parts of the history. Our ultimate goal is to place new constraints on the tectonic history of the Grenville Orogen, especially on the collapse and exhumation stages, and also to add to the evolving understanding of monazite behavior during metamorphism and deformation. This work will help to place the Adirondack massif within the context of gneiss domes and provide evidence about the role that this dome played in the collapse and exhumation of the orogen.", "TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. It supports theoretical research and education with the objective to model proton conduction in metal-organic frameworks through the development and application of a novel simulation methodology. Proton conduction in solids and porous materials is a process of fundamental importance for fuel cell technologies. Much of current research on fuel cells focuses on proton exchange membranes where the electrolytes are Nafion or some other sulfonated polymers. Since high proton conductivity is only obtained at high levels of hydration, the maximum operation temperature of current fuel cells is limited by the condensation point of water. Metal-organic frameworks are conceptually different separator materials that can transport protons at high temperatures and in low-humidity environments. One of the main advantages of metal-organic frameworks is the possibility to modify the inner surface of their pores with respect to hydrophilicity and acidity via suitable organic ligands, which can be used to control proton conduction at the molecular level. <br/><br/>This research project focuses on the molecular-level modeling of proton conduction in several chemically and structurally different metal-organic frameworks, all of which are of considerable interest for possible applications in fuel cell technologies. The specific foci are: 1) Proton conduction via water molecules adsorbed in the nanochannels, 2) Proton conduction via nitrogen-containing molecules adsorbed in the nanochannels, 3) Proton conduction in functionalized metal-organic frameworks. Proton conduction presents a challenge for current computational methodologies due to the dynamically changing bonding topologies of numerous molecular structures and complexity of the surrounding chemical environment. A precise characterization of proton conduction requires a physically complete representation of the underlying many-body interactions as well as an extensive sampling of the relevant phase space. The rigorous combination of these two components ultimately leads to the correct description of the free-energy landscape that governs the thermodynamics and kinetics of proton transport. A novel computational approach will be developed that meets this challenge by combining an ab initio-based representation of proton hopping with an accurate description of the framework-framework and framework-guests interactions. This will provide molecular-level insights into the mechanisms that govern proton transport in metal-organic frameworks, which is the first, necessary step toward the rational design of new conducting metal-organic framework structures that can function at higher temperatures and lower relative humidity for application in next generation fuel cells. <br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows will be involved in the research and will acquire a solid foundation in theoretical, physical, and materials chemistry. The computational approach developed within this project will be integrated in Amber, a popular molecular dynamics simulation package. The outreach component also includes the PI's continuing involvement with the Research Scholars Program, which provides high-school students from across the country with the opportunity to carry out summer research at UC San Diego.<br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. It supports an integrated theoretical and computational research and education program related to fuel cell technologies as alternative energy sources. The increasing energy demands and associated effects on the environment pose strict constraints on future use of natural resources such as oil and gas. Considerable effort has recently been devoted to the development of alternative energy sources such as fuel cells that convert chemical energy into directly usable forms. For example, hydrogen fuel cells exploit a fundamental chemical reaction in which the electrons are first drawn from hydrogen molecules to produce protons at the anode, and then are transferred to the cathode through an external circuit that produces direct current. At the same time, the protons are transported across a permeable membrane from the anode to the cathode where they are reunited with the electrons to form molecular hydrogen that subsequently reacts with oxygen to form water. The net result is thus the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy. Since the overall products are water and heat, hydrogen fuel cells are clean technologies with regard to environmental issues. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why fuel cells have not yet found wider application is related to their efficiency, which strongly depends on the ability of protons to quickly travel across the membrane from the anode to the cathode. The particular nature of the membranes that are currently used represent the major obstacle to the development of more efficient fuel cells. The primary goal of this project is to use computer simulation to characterize the molecular mechanisms that determine proton conduction in a new class of materials known as metal-organic frameworks. Metal-organic frameworks contain organic molecules that act as bridges between inorganic clusters to form highly porous three-dimensional structures. Due to the presence of microscopic pores and channels, metal-organic frameworks can thus be used as effective separators in fuel cell technologies in which protons can be shuttled from the anode to the cathode through intervening carrier molecules or through the framework itself.<br/><br/>The proposed project focuses on the molecular-level modeling of proton conduction in several chemically and structurally different metal-organic frameworks, all of which are of considerable interest for possible applications in future fuel cell technologies. In general terms, proton conduction presents an enormous challenge for current computational approaches due to its intrinsic complexity. A new methodology will be developed that meets this challenge by combining state-of-the-art simulation techniques with accurate descriptions of the molecular interactions. The resulting computational approach will be integrated into Amber, which is one of the most popular software packages for molecular dynamics simulations. Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows will be involved in the research and will acquire a solid foundation in theoretical, physical, and materials chemistry.

A fundamental approach for designing and predicting the mechanical reliability of these interfaces is proposed, with a view to replace the current empirical and rather time-consuming approaches that utilize accelerated test protocols.  Implementation of the proposed strategy requires (1) the development of a fundamental interface-strength-measuring tool capable of testing interfaces, in-situ, in actual device and package structures, (2) measurement of the tensile strength, in-situ, of the selected interface as a function of humidity, temperature, and time variables, and (3) quantification of the moisture content using FTIR and thermogravimetric analyses on each tested sample.  These will result in \"interface strength charts\" for predicting degradation at the selected interface for varying humidity and temperature conditions.  Well developed simulation codes can then predict stress concentrations, moisture accumulation, and temperature rise at any of the interfaces within the package assembly for determining (a) whether the interface will be able to survive processing and system integration cycles during the design phase itself, prior to any IC fabrication and packaging, and (b) the level of interface strength needed at the time of manufacturing for ensuring a prescribed service life.  The above procedure will first  be demonstrated by studying the underfill/Si3N4 passivation layer interface.

One possible factor is that they do not properly represent the radiative forcings from aerosols and tropospheric ozone that could be particularly important in the Arctic. This EaSM Type 1 project will develop an improved understanding of the distributions and decadal trends of aerosols and ozone in the Arctic, including black carbon (BC) deposition fluxes and albedo effects for snow and sea ice, and will study the implications for Arctic climate change over the 1980-2010 period. It will build an interdisciplinary partnership between atmospheric chemists using the GEOS-Chem CTM and cryosphere scientists using CCSM4, to better describe aerosol-chemistry-climate interactions in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The project will take advantage of intensive observations during the International Polar Year (IPY) to test and improve the GEOS-Chem representation of aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes in the Arctic. A 30-year GEOS-Chem simulation (1980-2010) with evolving sources from human activity and fires will be conducted and evaluated against long-term records. Aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes from GEOS-Chem will be input to CCSM4 to simulate Arctic radiative forcing and climate response over the 30-year period. Ensemble sensitivity simulations conducted with CCSM4 will diagnose the perturbations to temperature, sea ice, and atmospheric circulation associated with these radiative forcings. Knowledge gained from this project will be used to evaluate the simulation of Arctic aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and BC deposition fluxes within CESM. Fully coupled aerosol-chemistry-climate simulations of the 1980-2010 period will be conducted in CESM to assess Arctic climate response from aerosols and ozone and to investigate climate feedbacks.  This project will also provide policy analysts with information on the role of aerosols and tropospheric ozone in driving Arctic climate change.

Sedimentary accumulation and remobilization processes are important to understand not only for the sequestration of sedimens and metallic and organic pollutants, but also for nutrient storage and release.

A suite of 1-D, regional 3-D, and global 3-D models will be used to analyze airborne observations collected during the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox Experiment (TOPSE).  Major scientific issues to be examined include:  (1) the altitude and latitude distributions of the springtime O3 maximum and factors contributing to the variation in the spatial distributions; (2) the correlations among O3, NOx, NOy, CO, and hydrocarbons by time and latitude and their implications on the origin of the springtime O3 maximum and sources of HOx and NOx; (3) the impact of halogen radicals on chemistry in the Arctic and vicinity in spring.  These studies will involve assessing the relative roles of transport and chemistry in the tropospheric chemistry of this region.", "similar_id": [66638, 33324, 37749], "weight": [0.10295774787664413, 0.5599149465560913, 0.33712732791900635], "similar_title": ["Student Travel Support for the CGO 2013, HPCA 2013, and PPoPP 2013 Symposia Co-located in Shenzhen, China", "CPA (Gr&Vis): Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2007 Conference", "Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference"], "similar_abstract": ["This award will support student travel to three co-located conferences: the International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2013), the International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2013), and the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP 2013).

A suite of 1-D, regional 3-D, and global 3-D models will be used to analyze airborne observations collected during the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox Experiment (TOPSE). Major scientific issues to be examined include: (1) the altitude and latitude distributions of the springtime O3 maximum and factors contributing to the variation in the spatial distributions; (2) the correlations among O3, NOx, NOy, CO, and hydrocarbons by time and latitude and their implications on the origin of the springtime O3 maximum and sources of HOx and NOx; (3) the impact of halogen radicals on chemistry in the Arctic and vicinity in spring.

They will also conduct a statistical study of ENA events observed by the Geotail satellite.  The statistical study will identify trends in the composition of ENA during the course of a magnetic storm.  Comparison of ENA observations between the Geotail and Polar satellites will be made to compare the total ENA intensity at two locations in space.

Dynamically Reliable MEMS", "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an explosive growth of new process technologies, new device concepts, and new markets for integrated sensors and actuators, also referred to as micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). This growth has led to new challenges for computer-aided-design (CAD) of MEMS, with the ultimate goals being accurate, easy-to-use behavioral models that capture all the essential behavior, and permit predictable design modifications and optimization. This research investigates the lack of design guidelines for reliability with regard to dynamic (shock) loading. Such loading can occur either by choice (for example, MEMS launched on satellites), or by accidental drops onto hard surfaces. There is evidence that the small moveable parts of MEMS devices, such as suspended proof masses in accelerometers, experience fracture from dynamic loading levels which the devices are expected to withstand based on quasi-static loading models. It is hypothesized that the inertia of a packaged MEMS, when subject to even modest acceleration, provides a reservoir of kinetic energy which can then be transferred to the mechanical elements as acoustic waves, and cause fracture due to stress wave loading. This project examines the validity of this hypothesis by using numerical analyses to establish expected behavior. For confirmation, experimental studies of subjecting Si microstructures to stress-wave loading are being made. Modeling procedures to anticipate such failures, and by proper design, prevent them are being developed.<br/><br/>", "similar_id": [40367, 61805, 58428], "weight": [0.1549944281578064, 0.18252220749855042, 0.6624833345413208], "similar_title": ["CT-ISG:   Usable Cyber Trust Indicators", "SBIR Phase I:  Palatal Device Providing In-situ Sensory Feedback for Patients with Vestibular Imbalance", "EFRI-M3C: A Hybrid Control Systems Approach to Brain-Machine Interfaces for Exoskeleton Control"], "similar_abstract": ["When systems rely on a \"human in the loop\" to carry out a security-critical function, cyber trust indicators are often employed to communicate when and how to perform that function.  Indicators typically serve as warnings or status indicators that communicate information, remind users of information previously communicated, and influence behavior. They include a variety of security- and privacy-related symbols in the operating system status bar or browser chrome, pop-up alerts, security control panels, or symbols embedded in web content. However, a growing body of literature has found the effectiveness of many of these indicators to be rather disappointing. This research is systematically studying the effectiveness of cyber trust indicators and developing approaches to making these indicators most effective and usable.  The researchers are using cognitive psychology's \"mental models\" approach to study how both expert and non-expert personal computer users understand common cyber trust indicators. They are also using the \"Communication-Human Information Processing\" (C-HIP) model from warnings science to structure their evaluation and provide insights into the human information processing steps at which a warning is mostly likely to fail. Using an iterative design process, they are developing improved indicators for several common applications and evaluating the effectiveness of these indicators. The expected results include a set of specific recommendations for improving a set of common cyber trust indicators, a set of design patterns for designing effective cyber trust indicators, and a curriculum module for teaching students how to design effective and usable cyber trust indicators.<br/><br/>", "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a hidden and noninvasive assistive device that can provide in-situ sensory feedback of head movement for patients with vestibular imbalance. Loss of vestibular feedback in the sensorimotor control loop of the human body causes imbalance, which significantly increases the risk of falling, one of the leading causes of death in the elderly population. Patients with vestibular imbalance have reduced activity levels, which result in secondary problems including loss of muscle tone, decreased body strength, fatigue, and headache, leading to a significantly impaired life. The proposed device provides alternative sensory feedback to the palatal surface, a site that has been shown to possess high tactile sensitivity, but has not been explored for vestibular substitution. The objectives for Phase I of the project include: 1) development of a compact and energy-efficient electronic system that leads to a wearable battery-powered balance device; 2) development of methods for optimal electrotactile representation of the direction and range of head inclination and motion; and 3) preliminary evaluation of the wearable prototype for alternative sensory feedback and balance assistance in human subject experiments. The Phase I project is anticipated to demonstrate the enabling palate-based technology for cost-effective implementation of the device with desired dimensions and functionality, and the usefulness of the device for balance control.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the improvement of balance in patients with vestibular disorders, which are prevalent worldwide due to aging, disease, ototoxicity, and surgery that cause degradation or damage of the vestibular apparatus. Data showed that in US alone several millions of American adults reported problem with balance. Currently no practical devices are available to provide in-situ sensory feedback of head movement for patients with vestibular loss.  The proposed device captures this great market opportunity with its unique feature of being hidden and noninvasive while assisting vestibular patients in maintaining balance in various indoor and outdoor activities such as walking in a park, street, or shopping mall. It helps them to regain confidence in public settings, and increases their social participation, which will bring enormous benefits to their health and make their daily living more enjoyable. In addition, the device offers fresh opportunities for health professionals in the field of vestibular rehabilitation to conduct research on motion, imbalance, and treatments in uncontrolled settings. It provides a new tool for neuroscience researchers to study mechanisms of brain plasticity and perceptual learning involving use of palatal feedback in the sensorimotor control loop.", "This interdisciplinary research proposal brings together leaders in neurophysiology and brain-machine interfaces (BMI), control systems, and exoskeleton design to significantly advance our understanding of fundamental principles in the neural control of movement in scenarios that involve physical interactions with the world. Furthermore, this work will transform neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life for a large number of neurological patients. The central question that motivates this proposal is: Does the brain use motor programs to help it control a highly redundant multi-degree of freedom (DOF) biomechanical plant such as the arm? To answer this question, this project will conduct a series of experiments that require a combination of three major innovations at the experimental (BMI), theoretical (hybrid control), and technical (exoskeleton design) level. This proposal aims to synthesize all three innovations into a new experimental paradigm unifying brain, biomechanics, and behavior. Specifically, visually-cued motor plans in the motor cortices of macaque monkeys will be: 1) read by a BMI, 2) interpreted by a hybrid controller and a musculoskeletal model, and 3) translated into appropriate movements and stiffness in a multi-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>At a societal level, this proposal seeks to create a significant advancement in neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from paralysis due to lesions of the central nervous system or other neurological disorders. BMIs will make a great impact in the quality of life for neurological patients by providing reliable performance when interacting with real objects and in real-world scenarios. This proposal also informs motor systems neuroscience by proposing a novel framework to study how neural ensembles can learn to control a multi-DOF exoskeleton by volitional modulation of neural activity in real-world tasks. It provides a critical link between neural events and real-world dynamics through a novel hierarchical distributed control scheme for hybrid systems identification and control that captures the continuous time evolution of the arm/exoskeleton, as well as the dynamically changing sequence of tasks. No motor task of this complexity has ever been demonstrated in a BMI system. The potential impact of the proposed work is immense. If successful, this work will transform our understanding about how the brain controls movement, and will introduce a paradigm shift in the development of the next generation of neural prosthetics that will restore motor function in millions of neurologically impaired patients ? a development which may very well impact other domains such as human-machine interaction and innovative user interfaces. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The dissemination of data and research findings from this project will be done through a project website. Our codes will be open source, and the methods, algorithms and results will be available through publications in the fields of neuroscience, control and robotics. Through the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at Berkeley, research results from this program will be immediately accessible and distributed to a large engineering community, in particular other interdisciplinary research groups. Also, the findings in the proposed research will be outreached to K-12 students and their parents through various activities at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS), such as CAL-day. In addition, research findings will be disseminated through workshops at the main annual conferences in neuroscience, robotics, control, and biomedical engineering. The educational component of this proposal relies on BMI as a platform for interdisciplinary education in science and engineering. New graduate-level courses will be introduced and existing courses will be enhanced based on results of this project. The proposed efforts will open doors to student rotations between neuroscientists, control theorists and roboticists. In addition to postdocs and graduate students, undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the project: modeling, analysis, simulation, prototype development and experimentation. Special effort will be placed on the recruitment of individuals from underrepresented groups including women, thereby building on the strong record the PIs have in this area."], "person": 55907,

open-ocean iron enrichments experiments have demonstrated that the growth and biomass of phytoplankton are limited by low concentrations of available iron in waters characterized by high concentrations of dissolved nitrate and low standing stocks of chlorophyll (\"HNLC waters\"). The seminal open-water iron fertilization experiments were done in the early 1990's in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. Since that time, abundant new evidence has come to light that an even more extensive, and globally significant, HNLS region exists in the broad eastwardly flowing Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica.<br/><br/>In this project, researchers at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratory, Rutgers University, Oregon State University, University of Miami, and Lamont-Dougherty Earth Observatory will perform an open-water iron fertilization experiment in the Southern Ocean in regions just north of and just south of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ) along 170'W, an area characterized by high major nutrients and extremely low dissolved iron concentrations. The team will investigate (1) the role of iron on the biological pump in silicate-rich versus silicate-poor HNLC waters, (2) iron mediation of differential drawdown of major nutrients, (3) iron limitation of carbon fixation and export from surface waters, (4) the biophysical response to added iron, and (5) the potential effect of iron-induced carbon export on midwater remineralization and denitrification. The underlying hypothesis driving this field study is that the rate of phytoplankton production and the quantity of plant biomass in the Southern Ocean are differentially limited across the APFZ by iton and silicate availability during the major growth season and are responsible for the persistence of the HNLC condition. The results of this work are expected to contribute significantly to our understanding of important biogeochemical processes in the Southern Ocean. Factors that control the rate of new production bear directly on the global carbon cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and climate control.<br/><br/>This Southern Ocean Iron Experiment (SOFeX), north and south of the APFZ, will be carried out in a single field expedition in the austral summer of 2001-2002.", "similar_id": [37749, 53751, 66535], "weight": [0.05010269209742546, 0.8614773154258728, 0.08842001855373383], "similar_title": ["Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference", "Collaborative Research:  Type 1: LOI: L02170303: Arctic Climate Response to Decadal Changes in Radiative Forcing from Aerosols and Ozone", "Computer Modeling of Proton Conduction in Metal-Organic Frameworks"], "similar_abstract": ["Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference<br/><br/>This conference brings together researchers academia and industry focused on research topics related to the Graphics and Visualization subarea of the CPA cluster.

One possible factor is that they do not properly represent the radiative forcings from aerosols and tropospheric ozone that could be particularly important in the Arctic. This EaSM Type 1 project will develop an improved understanding of the distributions and decadal trends of aerosols and ozone in the Arctic, including black carbon (BC) deposition fluxes and albedo effects for snow and sea ice, and will study the implications for Arctic climate change over the 1980-2010 period. It will build an interdisciplinary partnership between atmospheric chemists using the GEOS-Chem CTM and cryosphere scientists using CCSM4, to better describe aerosol-chemistry-climate interactions in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The project will take advantage of intensive observations during the International Polar Year (IPY) to test and improve the GEOS-Chem representation of aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes in the Arctic. A 30-year GEOS-Chem simulation (1980-2010) with evolving sources from human activity and fires will be conducted and evaluated against long-term records. Aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes from GEOS-Chem will be input to CCSM4 to simulate Arctic radiative forcing and climate response over the 30-year period. Ensemble sensitivity simulations conducted with CCSM4 will diagnose the perturbations to temperature, sea ice, and atmospheric circulation associated with these radiative forcings. Knowledge gained from this project will be used to evaluate the simulation of Arctic aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and BC deposition fluxes within CESM. Fully coupled aerosol-chemistry-climate simulations of the 1980-2010 period will be conducted in CESM to assess Arctic climate response from aerosols and ozone and to investigate climate feedbacks.  This project will also provide policy analysts with information on the role of aerosols and tropospheric ozone in driving Arctic climate change.  Two graduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary environmental modeling.", "TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. It supports theoretical research and education with the objective to model proton conduction in metal-organic frameworks through the development and application of a novel simulation methodology. Proton conduction in solids and porous materials is a process of fundamental importance for fuel cell technologies. Much of current research on fuel cells focuses on proton exchange membranes where the electrolytes are Nafion or some other sulfonated polymers. Since high proton conductivity is only obtained at high levels of hydration, the maximum operation temperature of current fuel cells is limited by the condensation point of water. Metal-organic frameworks are conceptually different separator materials that can transport protons at high temperatures and in low-humidity environments. One of the main advantages of metal-organic frameworks is the possibility to modify the inner surface of their pores with respect to hydrophilicity and acidity via suitable organic ligands, which can be used to control proton conduction at the molecular level. <br/><br/>This research project focuses on the molecular-level modeling of proton conduction in several chemically and structurally different metal-organic frameworks, all of which are of considerable interest for possible applications in fuel cell technologies. The specific foci are: 1) Proton conduction via water molecules adsorbed in the nanochannels, 2) Proton conduction via nitrogen-containing molecules adsorbed in the nanochannels, 3) Proton conduction in functionalized metal-organic frameworks. Proton conduction presents a challenge for current computational methodologies due to the dynamically changing bonding topologies of numerous molecular structures and complexity of the surrounding chemical environment. A precise characterization of proton conduction requires a physically complete representation of the underlying many-body interactions as well as an extensive sampling of the relevant phase space. The rigorous combination of these two components ultimately leads to the correct description of the free-energy landscape that governs the thermodynamics and kinetics of proton transport. A novel computational approach will be developed that meets this challenge by combining an ab initio-based representation of proton hopping with an accurate description of the framework-framework and framework-guests interactions. This will provide molecular-level insights into the mechanisms that govern proton transport in metal-organic frameworks, which is the first, necessary step toward the rational design of new conducting metal-organic framework structures that can function at higher temperatures and lower relative humidity for application in next generation fuel cells. <br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows will be involved in the research and will acquire a solid foundation in theoretical, physical, and materials chemistry. The computational approach developed within this project will be integrated in Amber, a popular molecular dynamics simulation package. The outreach component also includes the PI's continuing involvement with the Research Scholars Program, which provides high-school students from across the country with the opportunity to carry out summer research at UC San Diego.<br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. It supports an integrated theoretical and computational research and education program related to fuel cell technologies as alternative energy sources. The increasing energy demands and associated effects on the environment pose strict constraints on future use of natural resources such as oil and gas. Considerable effort has recently been devoted to the development of alternative energy sources such as fuel cells that convert chemical energy into directly usable forms. For example, hydrogen fuel cells exploit a fundamental chemical reaction in which the electrons are first drawn from hydrogen molecules to produce protons at the anode, and then are transferred to the cathode through an external circuit that produces direct current. At the same time, the protons are transported across a permeable membrane from the anode to the cathode where they are reunited with the electrons to form molecular hydrogen that subsequently reacts with oxygen to form water. The net result is thus the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy. Since the overall products are water and heat, hydrogen fuel cells are clean technologies with regard to environmental issues. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why fuel cells have not yet found wider application is related to their efficiency, which strongly depends on the ability of protons to quickly travel across the membrane from the anode to the cathode. The particular nature of the membranes that are currently used represent the major obstacle to the development of more efficient fuel cells. The primary goal of this project is to use computer simulation to characterize the molecular mechanisms that determine proton conduction in a new class of materials known as metal-organic frameworks. Metal-organic frameworks contain organic molecules that act as bridges between inorganic clusters to form highly porous three-dimensional structures. Due to the presence of microscopic pores and channels, metal-organic frameworks can thus be used as effective separators in fuel cell technologies in which protons can be shuttled from the anode to the cathode through intervening carrier molecules or through the framework itself.<br/><br/>The proposed project focuses on the molecular-level modeling of proton conduction in several chemically and structurally different metal-organic frameworks, all of which are of considerable interest for possible applications in future fuel cell technologies. In general terms, proton conduction presents an enormous challenge for current computational approaches due to its intrinsic complexity. A new methodology will be developed that meets this challenge by combining state-of-the-art simulation techniques with accurate descriptions of the molecular interactions. The resulting computational approach will be integrated into Amber, which is one of the most popular software packages for molecular dynamics simulations. Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows will be involved in the research and will acquire a solid foundation in theoretical, physical, and materials chemistry. The outreach component of the proposed project also includes the PI continuing involvement with the Research Scholars Program, which provides high-school students from across the country with the

of dissolved iron in the ocean and the results of open-ocean iron enrichments experiments have demonstrated that the growth and biomass of phytoplankton are limited by low concentrations of available iron in waters characterized by high concentrations of dissolved nitrate and low standing stocks of chlorophyll (\"HNLC waters\").  The seminal open-water iron fertilization experiments were done in the early 1990's in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.  Since that time, abundant new evidence has come to light that an even more extensive, and globally significant, HNLS region exists in the broad eastwardly flowing Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica.<br/><br/>In this project, researchers at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratory, Rutgers University, Oregon State University, University of Miami, and Lamont-Dougherty Earth Observatory will perform an open-water iron fertilization experiment in the Southern Ocean in regions just north of and just south of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ) along 170'w, an area characterized by high major nutrients and extremely low dissolved iron concentrations.  The team will investigate (1) the role of iron on the biological pump in silicate-rich versus silicate-poor HNLC waters, (2) iron mediation of differential drawdown of major nutrients, (3) iron limitation of carbon fixation and export from surface waters, (4) the biophysical response to added iron, and (5) the potential effect of iron-induced carbon export on midwater remineralization and denitrification.  The underlying hypothesis driving this field study is that the rate of phytoplankton production and the quantity of plant biomass in the Southern Ocean are differentially limited across the APFZ by iton and silicate availability during the major growth season and are responsible for the persistence of the HNLC condition.  The results of this work are expected to contribute significantly to our understanding of important biogeochemical processes in the Southern Ocean.  Factors that control the rate of new production bear directly on the global carbon cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and climate control.<br/><br/>This Southern Ocean Iron Experiment (SOFeX), north and south of the APFZ, will be carried out in a single field expedition in the austral summer of 2001-2002.<br/><br/>", "similar_id": [37749, 66535, 53751], "weight": [0.04684105142951012, 0.08396443724632263, 0.8691944479942322], "similar_title": ["Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference", "Computer Modeling of Proton Conduction in Metal-Organic Frameworks", "Collaborative Research:  Type 1: LOI: L02170303: Arctic Climate Response to Decadal Changes in Radiative Forcing from Aerosols and Ozone"], "similar_abstract": ["Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2008 Conference<br/><br/>This conference brings together researchers academia and industry focused on research topics related to the Graphics and Visualization subarea of the CPA cluster.

It supports theoretical research and education with the objective to model proton conduction in metal-organic frameworks through the development and application of a novel simulation methodology. Proton conduction in solids and porous materials is a process of fundamental importance for fuel cell technologies. Much of current research on fuel cells focuses on proton exchange membranes where the electrolytes are Nafion or some other sulfonated polymers. Since high proton conductivity is only obtained at high levels of hydration, the maximum operation temperature of current fuel cells is limited by the condensation point of water. Metal-organic frameworks are conceptually different separator materials that can transport protons at high temperatures and in low-humidity environments. One of the main advantages of metal-organic frameworks is the possibility to modify the inner surface of their pores with respect to hydrophilicity and acidity via suitable organic ligands, which can be used to control proton conduction at the molecular level. <br/><br/>This research project focuses on the molecular-level modeling of proton conduction in several chemically and structurally different metal-organic frameworks, all of which are of considerable interest for possible applications in fuel cell technologies. The specific foci are: 1) Proton conduction via water molecules adsorbed in the nanochannels, 2) Proton conduction via nitrogen-containing molecules adsorbed in the nanochannels, 3) Proton conduction in functionalized metal-organic frameworks. Proton conduction presents a challenge for current computational methodologies due to the dynamically changing bonding topologies of numerous molecular structures and complexity of the surrounding chemical environment. A precise characterization of proton conduction requires a physically complete representation of the underlying many-body interactions as well as an extensive sampling of the relevant phase space. The rigorous combination of these two components ultimately leads to the correct description of the free-energy landscape that governs the thermodynamics and kinetics of proton transport. A novel computational approach will be developed that meets this challenge by combining an ab initio-based representation of proton hopping with an accurate description of the framework-framework and framework-guests interactions. This will provide molecular-level insights into the mechanisms that govern proton transport in metal-organic frameworks, which is the first, necessary step toward the rational design of new conducting metal-organic framework structures that can function at higher temperatures and lower relative humidity for application in next generation fuel cells. <br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows will be involved in the research and will acquire a solid foundation in theoretical, physical, and materials chemistry. The computational approach developed within this project will be integrated in Amber, a popular molecular dynamics simulation package. The outreach component also includes the PI's continuing involvement with the Research Scholars Program, which provides high-school students from across the country with the opportunity to carry out summer research at UC San Diego.<br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. It supports an integrated theoretical and computational research and education program related to fuel cell technologies as alternative energy sources. The increasing energy demands and associated effects on the environment pose strict constraints on future use of natural resources such as oil and gas. Considerable effort has recently been devoted to the development of alternative energy sources such as fuel cells that convert chemical energy into directly usable forms. For example, hydrogen fuel cells exploit a fundamental chemical reaction in which the electrons are first drawn from hydrogen molecules to produce protons at the anode, and then are transferred to the cathode through an external circuit that produces direct current. At the same time, the protons are transported across a permeable membrane from the anode to the cathode where they are reunited with the electrons to form molecular hydrogen that subsequently reacts with oxygen to form water. The net result is thus the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy. Since the overall products are water and heat, hydrogen fuel cells are clean technologies with regard to environmental issues. <br/><br/>One of the reasons why fuel cells have not yet found wider application is related to their efficiency, which strongly depends on the ability of protons to quickly travel across the membrane from the anode to the cathode. The particular nature of the membranes that are currently used represent the major obstacle to the development of more efficient fuel cells. The primary goal of this project is to use computer simulation to characterize the molecular mechanisms that determine proton conduction in a new class of materials known as metal-organic frameworks. Metal-organic frameworks contain organic molecules that act as bridges between inorganic clusters to form highly porous three-dimensional structures. Due to the presence of microscopic pores and channels, metal-organic frameworks can thus be used as effective separators in fuel cell technologies in which protons can be shuttled from the anode to the cathode through intervening carrier molecules or through the framework itself.<br/><br/>The proposed project focuses on the molecular-level modeling of proton conduction in several chemically and structurally different metal-organic frameworks, all of which are of considerable interest for possible applications in future fuel cell technologies. In general terms, proton conduction presents an enormous challenge for current computational approaches due to its intrinsic complexity. A new methodology will be developed that meets this challenge by combining state-of-the-art simulation techniques with accurate descriptions of the molecular interactions. The resulting computational approach will be integrated into Amber, which is one of the most popular software packages for molecular dynamics simulations. Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows will be involved in the research and will acquire a solid foundation in theoretical, physical, and materials chemistry. The outreach component of the proposed project also includes the PI continuing involvement with the Research Scholars Program, which provides high-school students from across the country with the opportunity to carry out summer research at UC San Diego.", "Current general circulation models (GCMs) have difficulty reproducing the rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss observed over the past decades. One possible factor is that they do not properly represent the radiative forcings from aerosols and tropospheric ozone that could be particularly important in the Arctic. This EaSM Type 1 project will develop an improved understanding of the distributions and decadal trends of aerosols and ozone in the Arctic, including black carbon (BC) deposition fluxes and albedo effects for snow and sea ice, and will study the implications for Arctic climate change over the 1980-2010 period. It will build an interdisciplinary partnership between atmospheric chemists using the GEOS-Chem CTM and cryosphere scientists using CCSM4, to better describe aerosol-chemistry-climate interactions in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The project will take advantage of intensive observations during the International Polar Year (IPY) to test and improve the GEOS-Chem representation of aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes in the Arctic. A 30-year GEOS-Chem simulation (1980-2010) with evolving sources from human activity and fires will be conducted and evaluated against long-term records. Aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes from GEOS-Chem will be input to CCSM4 to simulate Arctic radiative forcing and climate response over the 30-year period. Ensemble sensitivity simulations conducted with CCSM4 will diagnose the perturbations to temperature, sea ice, and atmospheric circulation associated with these radiative forcings. Knowledge gained from this project will be used to evaluate the simulation of Arctic aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and BC deposition fluxes within CESM. Fully coupled aerosol-chemistry-climate simulations of the 1980-2010 period will be conducted in CESM to assess Arctic climate response from aerosols and ozone and to investigate climate feedbacks.  This project will also provide policy analysts with information on the role of aerosols and tropospheric ozone in driving Arctic climate change.  Two graduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary environmental modeling."], "person": 18462, "graph": {"paper_cite_paper": [[2, 4, 4, 12, 13, 18, 21, 23, 24, 38, 41, 45, 49, 51, 51, 68, 80,

As new curriculum materials are created it is critical we find out how the use of innovative curriculum materials can provide professional development for the teachers who use those materials.  The project will use existing elementary school mathematics curriculum materials (\"Math Workshop,\" written several decades ago by Wirtz, Botel, Beberman and Sawyer) as a base for creating one or two sample units which illustrate a proposed curriculum organization framework.  These materials will be piloted with a small group of teachers and students in Massachusetts.  Evaluation data will include teacher interviews and classroom observations.  The evaluation will focus particularly on the ways that teachers' knowledge of mathematics changes as a result of using the materials.

The project leverages a new network of ~250 research nodes with sensors that constantly collect atmospheric data (CO2, CO, NO2, O3, temperature and relative humidity) currently under development for deployment in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Through this award, 22 nodes of the network that will provide data for use in K-12 educational programs administered by Chabot is being built and deployed. Seminars, classes, teacher trainings, website information and exhibits on the science of climate change that support the educational use of this network are being created to support in-service teachers and their students from four schools in the region, including the highly diverse Oakland Unified School District.  Joint activities to bring UCB faculty, graduate students and undergraduate researchers into regular contact with the in-service teachers and K-12 students from the greater Bay Area are included in the project.  Data collected through the sensor network offers a place-based teaching opportunity for students in the Chabot programs and at host site schools.  An annual seminar to report on the scientific results of the study offers an additional opportunity for engagement of the K-12 students, teachers and members of the public who participate in Chabot's educational efforts. The project supports a developing regional alliance between the UCB Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) Program, the UCB Earth and Planetary Sciences Department and Atmospheric Science Center, Chabot and its partner, the Oakland Unified School District, for the specific purpose of increasing the participation of traditionally underrepresented students in the geosciences and STEM disciplines.  The project provides a new model for integrating research, education and outreach that can be replicated in municipalities around the globe.", "This interdisciplinary research proposal brings together leaders in neurophysiology and brain-machine interfaces (BMI), control systems, and exoskeleton design to significantly advance our understanding of fundamental principles in the neural control of movement in scenarios that involve physical interactions with the world. Furthermore, this work will transform neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life for a large number of neurological patients. The central question that motivates this proposal is: Does the brain use motor programs to help it control a highly redundant multi-degree of freedom (DOF) biomechanical plant such as the arm? To answer this question, this project will conduct a series of experiments that require a combination of three major innovations at the experimental (BMI), theoretical (hybrid control), and technical (exoskeleton design) level. This proposal aims to synthesize all three innovations into a new experimental paradigm unifying brain, biomechanics, and behavior. Specifically, visually-cued motor plans in the motor cortices of macaque monkeys will be: 1) read by a BMI, 2) interpreted by a hybrid controller and a musculoskeletal model, and 3) translated into appropriate movements and stiffness in a multi-DOF upper-limb exoskeleton. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>At a societal level, this proposal seeks to create a significant advancement in neuroprosthetic systems to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from paralysis due to lesions of the central nervous system or other neurological disorders. BMIs will make a great impact in the quality of life for neurological patients by providing reliable performance when interacting with real objects and in real-world scenarios. This proposal also informs motor systems neuroscience by proposing a novel framework to study how neural ensembles can learn to control a multi-DOF exoskeleton by volitional modulation of neural activity in real-world tasks. It provides a critical link between neural events and real-world dynamics through a novel hierarchical distributed control scheme for hybrid systems identification and control that captures the continuous time evolution of the arm/exoskeleton, as well as the dynamically changing sequence of tasks. No motor task of this complexity has ever been demonstrated in a BMI system. The potential impact of the proposed work is immense. If successful, this work will transform our understanding about how the brain controls movement, and will introduce a paradigm shift in the development of the next generation of neural prosthetics that will restore motor function in millions of neurologically impaired patients ? a development which may very well impact other domains such as human-machine interaction and innovative user interfaces. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The dissemination of data and research findings from this project will be done through a project website. Our codes will be open source, and the methods, algorithms and results will be available through publications in the fields of neuroscience, control and robotics. Through the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at Berkeley, research results from this program will be immediately accessible and distributed to a large engineering community, in particular other interdisciplinary research groups. Also, the findings in the proposed research will be outreached to K-12 students and their parents through various activities at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS), such as CAL-day. In addition, research findings will be disseminated through workshops at the main annual conferences in neuroscience, robotics, control, and biomedical engineering. The educational component of this proposal relies on BMI as a platform for interdisciplinary education in science and engineering. New graduate-level courses will be introduced and existing courses will be enhanced based on results of this project. The proposed efforts will open doors to student rotations between neuroscientists, control theorists and roboticists. In addition to postdocs and graduate students, undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the project: modeling, analysis, simulation, prototype development and experimentation. Special effort will be placed on the recruitment of individuals from underrepresented groups including women, thereby building on the strong record the PIs have in this area."], "person": 15876,
